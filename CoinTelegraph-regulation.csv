Shaquille O’Neal claims process servers 'tossed' FTX legal papers at his moving car

The NBA star appeared in a June 2022 commercial saying he was “all in” on FTX, one of many endorsements that led to a class-action lawsuit following the exchange’s collapse.

Lawyers for NBA star Shaquille O’Neal, who previously endorsed the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, have claimed two process servers inadequately delivered legal documents after previous failed attempts.

In a May 8 filing for the United States District Court in the Southern District of Florida, O’Neal’s legal team said following “a failed motion to serve” the NBA star, two process servers “tossed” papers for a legal complaint in front of his moving car. According to the filing, O’Neal did not stop to pick up the papers but left them in the road.

“This purported ‘service’ is inadequate under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Georgia law,” said the filing. “It should be quashed, and the claims against Mr. O’Neal dismissed.”

O’Neal was one of many high-profile figures who endorsed FTX before its bankruptcy filing in November 2022. The NBA star appeared in a commercial saying he was “all in” for the crypto exchange. Following the exchange’s collapse and facing potential legal action, O’Neal reportedly said he was “just a paid spokesperson” for the firm.

In November, the Moskowitz law firm filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Edwin Garrison and other FTX investors against celebrities and sports figures for promoting the exchange. A similar lawsuit filed by the same firm in March targeted crypto influencers, including YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, who allegedly promoted FTX’s “crypto fraud without disclosing compensation.”

Moskowitz reported on April 16 that O’Neal had been served with the legal complaint outside his house following several unsuccessful attempts. The law firm did not specifically mention delivering the documents to the NBA star in his car or otherwise throwing them.

“As Mr. O’Neal — who never exited his car — drove past the strangers lurking outside his home, one of the process servers ‘tossed the legal documents at the front of’ his car,” said the May 8 filing. “When the documents hit the car, which was moving ‘at a high rate of speed,’ the documents ‘f[e]ll onto the road,’ and the process servers ‘l[e]ft the legal documents on the road where they landed’ — that is, on the public road.”

According to the filing, this alleged method of serving legal documents was “insufficient under Georgia law” and inadequate:

“Throwing papers at a moving car and leaving them unattended on a public highway ‘is not good tender as it provides no way of knowing whether the papers landed in physical proximity to’ Mr. O’Neal.”

Moskowitz has received authorization from the court to serve other individuals connected to the lawsuit, including by tweet in the case of crypto YouTuber Tom Nash.

BoE fintech head says crypto doesn’t ‘fulfill any of the functions of money’

At a recent event, Tom Mutton, the Bank of England’s head of fintech, touted the privacy benefits of CBDCs while denouncing the anonymity of cryptocurrencies.

The Bank of England’s director of fintech, Tom Hutton, recently spoke out on the United Kingdom’s plans to institute a central bank digital currency (CBDC) at the Crypto and Digital Assets Summit in London.

According to a report, Hutton’s talk focused on privacy and anonymity — concepts he says are at odds with each other regarding the Bank of England’s digital currency focus.

While describing the U.K.’s plans for a digital pound as only being viable if “it has the very highest standards of privacy,” Mutton explained such a product was never meant to feature anonymity:

“Privacy and anonymity are used synonymously in a way they shouldn’t be.”

Apparently referencing the potential for cryptocurrency to be used in the commission of criminal acts — something experts estimate accounts for only 0.10% to 0.15% of all cryptocurrency use — Mutton also mentioned that anonymity was “a public policy problem and something that should not be allowed to continue.”

In further comments, Mutton explained that the digital pound would not be interoperable with cryptocurrencies. His reasoning: They don’t “fulfill any of the functions of money.”

Related: Canada’s central bank asks citizens what they want in a digital dollar

Mutton’s comments come less than a month after the Bank of England’s deputy governor, John Cunliffe, spoke at the Innovate Finance Global Summit in London.

During the April 17 event, Cunliffe tackled CBDCs and stablecoins, telling eventgoers the latter would “offer the possibility of greater efficiency and functionality in payments,” but that “it is extremely unlikely that any of the current offerings would meet the standards for robustness and uniformity we currently apply both to commercial bank money and to the existing payment systems.”

In reference to a national CBDC, Cunliffe said a digital pound is “likely to be needed if current trends in payments and money […] continue.”

The Bank of England has yet to announce when the digital pound could launch — or, indeed, whether it will at all. In February, the bank issued guidance suggesting, as Cunliffe recently reiterated, such a product might be needed in the future, but that it was “too early to decide” as of now.

BRC-20 tokens surpass $1B market cap as wallet providers prepare integration

The growth in BRC-20 tokens comes just two months after the creation of the Bitcoin token fungibility protocol.

On May 9, the total market capitalization of BRC-20 Bitcoin tokens surpassed $1 billion, with a total trading volume of $207.7 million in the past 24 hours. Some of the most notable deployed tokens include ORDI, NALS, VMPX, PEPE and MEME, with price variance of between +11% and -55% within the past day.

According to analysts at multichain wallet BitKeep, the BRC-20 token standard is a novel form of fungible token that “employs Ordinals and Inscriptions to create and manage token contracts, token minting, and token transfers, which are stored on the Bitcoin base chain."" Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each satoshi, or 0.00000001 Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,770

, enabling its tracking and transfer. Meanwhile, the “inscription” process adds a layer of data to each satoshi, allowing users to create unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.

The BRC-20 token standard was developed by Twitter user Domo on March 8. Currently, there are over 14,000 BRC-20 tokens deployed on Bitcoin compared to an estimated 400 million tokens on Ethereum. Despite its traction, BitKeep researchers wrote, “BRC-20’s creator has openly stated that the standard is worthless and that users should not waste money mass minting this fun experiment.""

gm. I'm glad that some people like the experiment. Some additional notes.
1. These will be worthless. Please do not waste money mass minting.
2. Due to how some inscription tools are set up, the 'balance' may be minted to the intermediary address used in https://t.co/mja39YGIow…

— domo (@domodata) March 9, 2023

On May 8, BitKeep announced that it would soon support the ordinals protocol and BRC-20 protocol on its mobile and plugin-extension platforms. A new Bitcoin NFT section will also be included in the BitKeep NFT marketplace, allowing for the display, minting, transfer and trading of BTC NFTs based on the ordinal protocol. Developers wrote:

“BitKeep will continue to monitor new protocols, such as BRC-21, and provide more diverse support and services based on market trends and user demands.""

Despite being enthusiastic about its outlook, Trust Wallet does not support Bitcoin ordinals. Meanwhile, MetaMask added a new feature allowing users to store ordinals in February. Cryptocurrency hardware wallet provider Ledger also supports the ordinals protocol. 

3/4 BitKeep will also be compatible with the #Taproot address format and support the BRC-20 protocol, providing asset display, transfers, and trading services for BRC-20 tokens.

A federal judge has sentenced Ishan Wahi, the former product manager at Coinbase Global accused of insider trading, to 24 months in prison.

In a May 9 hearing in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge Loretta Preska sentenced Wahi to 2 years in prison for his role in using confidential information he obtained during his time working at Coinbase to profit off new listings of tokens, totaling up to $1.5 million. Preska ordered Wahi to surrender by June 21 at 2:00 PM ET to serve his sentence at the Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution in New Jersey. Following his time in prison, he will be subject to two years of supervised release for each count, running concurrently.

“You spoke very nicely, you said all the right things,” said the judge in regard to Wahi. “I hope that you can make this up to your parents.”

The former Coinbase employee — along with his brother Nikhil Wahi and associate Sameer Ramani — allegedly used confidential information he obtained from Coinbase to profit off new listings of tokens, totaling more than $1 million. U.S. Authorities arrested Ishan and Nikhil in July 2022 as they were attempting to flee the country to travel to India.

Wahi’s counsel argued that in considering sentencing the judge should weigh Ishan's immigration status in the United States, that this was a non-violent offense, and that he had “zero criminal history” prior to his arrest. Friends and family members including Wahi’s mother appeared in court in person for the sentencing.

“I submit that there’s no need for this court to impose additional punishment,” said counsel. “He has lost his job. He has lost his reputation. He has suffered an enormous amount of negative publicity both here in the United States and in India.”

The former Coinbase product manager also directly addressed the judge, saying he was “very sorry” for his actions and said he had “made a huge mistake”. Prosecutors argued that unlike his brother Nikhil and Ramani, Ishan was the most culpable by orchestrating the insider trading scheme:

“This was not a one-off mistake — this was over a ten-month period [...] Having access to the kind of information that this defendant had access to was like being able to read the newspaper a day in advance.”

The brothers pleaded guilty to criminal insider trading charges, with Ishan reportedly agreeing to a sentence of between 36 and 47 months in prison. Nikhil pled guilty to charges related to wire fraud conspiracy in September 2022 and was subsequently sentenced to 10 months in prison. At the time of publication, Ramani remained at large.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has also targeted Ishan in a parallel case involving potential violations of securities laws. As of April 3, the SEC said it had reached “an agreement in principle” with the former Coinbase product manager.

Financial technology company PayPal recently disclosed its cryptocurrency holdings in a quarterly report filed to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

Claiming a combined total of $943 million in cryptocurrency assets as of March 31, 2023, the filing shows a 56% increase over the company’s previous quarter where PayPal disclosed $604 million.

PayPal’s reported total financial liabilities for this quarter were $1.2 billion, with crypto assets making up 77.9% — up more than 10% from 2022’s reported fourth quarter liabilities.

According to the report, PayPal considers its crypto assets a “safeguarding liability” due to the “unique risks associated with cryptocurrencies.” The disclosure also indicates that the specific cryptocurrencies held by the company remain unchanged since last quarter:

“We allow our customers in certain markets to buy, hold, sell, receive, and send certain cryptocurrencies as well as use the proceeds from sales of cryptocurrencies to pay for purchases at checkout. These cryptocurrencies consist of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin (collectively, ‘our customers’ crypto assets’).”

Custody of the assets PayPal holds on behalf of its customers remains limited to third-party holding companies. PayPal recognizes that this presents a liability for customers in the event that third parties are unable to process transactions — a statement carried over from last quarter’s filing — however, the filing also indicates that no such fault has yet occurred:

“As of March 31, 2023, the Company has not incurred any safeguarding loss events, and therefore, the crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset were recorded at the same value.”

The Q1 2023 cryptocurrency asset breakdown for PayPal includes $499 million in Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,770

 (up from December’s $291 million), $362 million in Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 (up from $250 million), and $82 million composed of Bitcoin Cash 

BCH

$121

 and Litecoin 

LTC

$80.18

 (up from $63 million).

PayPal’s profitability also increased in the first quarter. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, the company disclosed per-share earnings of $0.70, up from $0.43 in the first quarter of 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, PayPal’s per-share earnings were $1.17, up from $0.88 in the first quarter of 2022.

Coinbase’s legal chief has requested the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) make several revisions to its proposed regulation on the responsibilities of registered investment advisers (RIAs) for storing client assets with qualified custodians.

Although the SEC acknowledges Coinbase Custody Trust Company as a “qualified custodian,“ Coinbase contends that the updated RIA custody rule unfairly targets crypto and makes improper assumptions about custodial practices based on securities. According to a May 8 letter from Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal, the proposed SEC rulemaking fails to safeguard other asset classes, such as cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase Custody Trust Company is recognized as a qualified custodian for RIA clients. This custodian is responsible for protecting client assets from potential threats such as bankruptcy and cyberattacks.

This letter advocates for expanding the custody obligations proposal to ensure that it remains adaptable to future investments and protects them appropriately.

An RIA is a company that advises clients on investments in securities and may handle their investment portfolios. These firms are registered with the SEC or state securities administrators, depending on the value of the assets under management.

In the letter addressed to the SEC, Grewal criticized the proposed rulemaking titled “Safeguarding Advisory Client Assets, Proposed Rule 223-1” as misguided. Grewal called for a revision to the proposal and staff guidance, highlighting the need to safeguard all asset classes, including crypto assets, which haven’t been classified as securities until now.

Grewal suggests several revisions to the rule to protect investors, including defining state trust companies and other state-regulated financial institutions as qualified custodians, a longstanding congressional and SEC policy. He also proposes allowing limited exposure to non-qualified custodians and removing the ban on RIA client trades on crypto exchanges, which are not qualified custodians.

The SEC is expected to comply with the court order and respond to Coinbase’s writ of mandamus this week. Coinbase filed a lawsuit in April 2022, requesting that the court compel the SEC to publicly disclose its stance on a petition submitted several months prior. In the petition, the exchange posed 50 specific questions about the regulatory treatment of certain digital assets.

Almost 400 virtual asset service providers (VASPS) have voluntarily shut down or had their authorizations revoked in Estonia following the government’s recently enhanced Terrorist Financing Prevention and Anti-Money Laundering laws (AML) that came into effect in March.

The amended laws expanded the defined scope of VASPs, required firms to have legitimate links to Estonia, increased licensing fees, and capital and information reporting requirements, along with introducing the Financial Action Task Force Travel Rule.

According to a May 8 statement from the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the amendment to the AML laws on March 15 has since seen almost 200 domestic crypto service providers voluntarily shut down.

Source: Republic of Estonia Financial Intelligence Unit

Another 189 also had their authorizations revoked due to “non-compliance with the requirements.”

“Given the documents submitted by the service providers that have lost their authorizations, and their methods of operation and the risks involved, it can be argued that the legislator’s response with regard to the amendments to the Act, and the supervision activities both before and after the amendments, have been relevant,” noted Matis Mäeker, the director of the Financial Intelligence Unit, adding:

“In renewing authorisations, we saw situations that would surprise every supervisor.”

Following the hefty clear-out, there were 100 active crypto firms registered in Estonia as of May 1, according to the FIU.

The FIU highlighted a number of general issues it found within the companies it forcibly shut down, particularly relating to misleading company information.

To name a few examples, some companies had registered board members and company contacts unbeknownst to the actual individuals themselves. Other companies had a number of people on the books who had falsified professional backgrounds on their resumes.

It also appears that many companies had copy and pasted identical business plans from each other, which were also found to be lacking “any logic or connection with Estonia.”

Estonia has made a considered effort to enact strong AML laws across the board over the past few years. This is primarily due to the discovery in 2018 that around $235 billion worth of illicit capital had been laundered through the Estonian branch of Denmark megabank Danske Bank.

The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has also had an impact, as Estonia has pushed to “cut off revenues supporting Russia’s war machine and protect international financial systems,” via strong AML regulation as part of its partnership with the U.S.

Another factor that likely has contributed to the recently enhanced AML laws is its membership in the European Union, therefore meaning it will soon have to implement the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) laws that are slated to come into effect in early 2025.

Under MiCA, crypto firms will be subject to stringent AML and terrorism prevention requirements.

A proposal by the United States securities regulator to tighten rules around crypto custody has been met with opposition from at least two proponents of the industry, according to recently filed letters.

Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

On May 8 — the deadline for comments on the proposal — crypto industry advocacy body Blockchain Association filed its letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) criticizing its proposal to amend its custody rule.

Three days earlier, a similar letter was sent by Web3 venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).

Marisa Tashman Coppel, a policy lawyer at the association, tweeted on May 8 that the rule would “drastically curtail investment in digital assets” and claimed that in its current form, the rule is “unlawful.”

The same day, a16z general counsel Miles Jennings tweeted its letter, saying the firm “did not mince words” and called the SEC proposal a “misguided and transparent attempt to wage war on crypto.”

In its letter, the Blockchain Association provided over a dozen separate arguments to rebuff the SEC. Among other claims, it said the rule exceeds the SEC’s authority, would inhibit advisers from transacting with crypto exchanges and would leave investors’ assets at more risk.

A16z detailed similar arguments in its letter but focused more on its effects on registered investment advisers, namely that advisors would be prevented from using crypto and the rules could violate the duty of care the SEC requires of such firms.

It called the prohibition against advisors being able to trade crypto on centralized exchanges “illegal, unworkable and dangerous.”

Yet to be approved by the SEC, the February proposal would apply more stringent rules on investment advisers in the custody of assets, inclusive of crypto.

Firms would need to properly segregate assets and custodians will be required to have annual audits from public accountants among a raft of other transparency measures.

Gensler has specifically taken aim at crypto exchanges with the rule, and said some crypto trading platforms offering custody services are not actual “qualified custodians.”

The proposal even saw pushback from within the SEC. Commissioner Hester Pierce questioned the rule’s “workability and breadth” and its seeming targeting of crypto and crypto-related companies.

In court documents filed in the Southern District Court in New York on May 8, SBF’s legal team pushed to dismiss everything apart from three counts of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

Commenting on the move, crypto researcher Molly White suggested that “at least part of it seems to come down to the fact that additional charges were added after SBF's extradition agreement was made.”

SBF was initially extradited to the U.S. from the Bahamas to face eight criminal charges of alleged fraud and money laundering; however, his legal team is arguing that the four of the five additional charges that were since been added from February “violates the Treaty’s rule of specialty provision.”

Under the “rule of specialty,"" the requesting state (the U.S.) is generally bound to trial the extradited offender (SBF) only for the offense for which they were extradited.

“During the extradition proceedings in The Bahamas, it was the understanding of all parties in court, coram judice¸ and the Court itself, that the specialty provisions applied notwithstanding the use of the simplified procedure. There was no waiver of the rule of specialty. To the contrary, there was an express acknowledgment that it applied,” the lawyers argued.

These four charges include conspiracy to commit bank fraud and other individual wire fraud charges related to his alleged actions at FTX and Alameda. The most recent charge added, on March 28, concerns the alleged $40 million bribery of a Chinese government official.

Aside from this, SBF’s lawyers are also seeking to dismiss other charges relating to “conspiracy to defraud the United States” and charges relating to wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, arguing there has been a failure to state an adequate offense in these counts.

According to his legal team, the initial indictment sent via a Diplomatic Note fails to properly “specify the violation” relating to campaign financing laws, and it also doesn’t “reference any U.S. bank accounts, including any bank accounts affiliated with FTX or Alameda” relating to the wire fraud charges.

U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan will hear arguments on June 15 on this dismissal request, and prosecutors will have until May 29 to respond.

Despite the rest of SBF’s inner circle all pleading guilty and agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, the man himself has pleaded not guilty to the charges laid against him.

SBF has been on house arrest in his parent’s home in Paolo Alto since December. Recently Judge Kaplan approved taps on SBF’s parents’ phones as a way of meeting bail conditions, despite SBF’s legal team requesting a revision.

Canada’s central bank asks citizens what they want in a digital dollar

Canadians are being asked what features they wish to see in a digital Canadian dollar even though there are no plans yet to issue one.

Canadians are being asked to submit what features they want to be included in a potential digital Canadian dollar, with the country’s central bank opening a consultation to the public.

On May 8, the Bank of Canada (BoC) launched a public consultation that will run until June 19, noting it’s exploring a virtual loonie as “the world becomes increasingly digital.”

The BoC’s senior deputy governor Carolyn Rogers said in a statement the bank wants to hear what Canadians “value most in the design of a digital dollar” to help it make choices relating to its security and reliability along with ensuring it “meets the needs of Canadians.”

Hey Canada, we need your input!

Our public consultation on a potential #DigitalCanadianDollar is now LIVE. #HaveYourSay by June 19: https://t.co/p8BdG3tQ9h pic.twitter.com/vKRoBfAngu

— Bank of Canada (@bankofcanada) May 8, 2023

The bank was quick to state that it's not starting work on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and wasn’t looking to replace cash if it does.

“At this time, a digital Canadian dollar is not needed. And any decision to issue one rests with Parliament and the Government of Canada.”

“Cash isn’t going anywhere,” the BoC added. It said, however, that many Canadians could be excluded from the economy in the future if the use of banknotes falls.

If a CBDC was issued, physical notes would still be provided “for those who want them” the bank said.

The BoC also outlined the possibility that cryptocurrencies or foreign CBDCs “could become widely used in Canada.”

It claimed this scenario could compromise the Canadian dollar and “pose a risk to the stability of our financial system.”

The consultation’s questionnaire asks Canadians a wide range of questions including the payment methods they’ve used in the last month, how often they would potentially use a Canadian CBDC and what design features they wish to see.

It also specifically asks if the survey taker uses or holds cryptocurrencies and features a range of demographic questions about gender, age, education and income.

The BoC said it will publish a report summarizing the consultation “later this year.”

Last week brought several significant international developments in regulation. Argentina’s central bank banned payment providers from offering crypto transactions, adding that it intends to reduce the country’s payment-system exposure to digital assets. While local payment providers refuse to comment on the decision, Argentina’s fintech chamber urged the government to reconsider, claiming that “it limits access to a technology that offers multiple benefits and opportunities for our society.”

In France, the Senate Committee on Economic Affairs approved an amendment allowing registered cryptocurrency companies to hire social media influencers for advertising and promotional purposes. The new wording would allow companies registered with France’s Financial Markets Authority to hire product influencers.

Meanwhile, Nigeria is preparing new industry regulations for digital asset platforms. The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering allowing licensed digital exchanges to list tokens backed by specific assets, including equity, debt and property. The SEC also aims to register fintech firms as digital sub-brokers, crowdfunding intermediaries, fund managers and tokenized coins issuers. The authority will not register crypto exchanges until the central bank provides clear regulations for the crypto market.

White House to build international standards for DLT

The United States Government released the national standards strategy for key and emerging technologies, with blockchain being one of them. The national strategy suggests that distributed ledger technology (DLT) and digital infrastructure would increasingly impact and be widely used in the economic sector. Some key areas where these technologies will be actively tested include automated and connected infrastructure, such as smart communities and the Internet of Things. DLT can be especially useful in building cybersecurity and privacy-based features and services.

North Carolina House passes bill banning CBDC payments to the state

The North Carolina House of Representatives has unanimously passed legislation prohibiting payments to the U.S. state using a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The latest version of the legislation aims to prohibit individuals from using CBDCs for any payments to the state. It also bars the Federal Reserve from using North Carolina as a potential testing ground for its own CBDC pilot. The bill will now move to the Senate, where it must pass before being signed into law or vetoed by Governor Roy Cooper.

The legislation effectively enshrines crypto miners’ rights in the state by revising existing laws, prohibiting discriminatory electrical rates for mining firms and not allowing taxation for crypto used as a payment method. It was introduced partly as a preventive measure in response to certain proposals in other states.

A state-subsidized Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company recently announced the launch of “Spark Model,” an AI system designed to compete directly with OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

The launch by the company, iFlytek, took place at a tech event in Hefei called “Spark Desk” and featured a full demonstration of the new system’s capabilities.

Per a translation provided by Bing, iFlytek founder and president Liu Qingfeng told event attendees that the Spark Model — also referred to as the “cognitive big model” — represented the “dawn of general artificial intelligence.”

While there’s no scientific consensus on whether general artificial intelligence (also referred to as artificial general intelligence, or AGI) is even possible using current machine learning techniques, the billionaire tech mogul did offer a comparison to ChatGPT and a timeline for updates:

“This year, we will continue to upgrade the big model, and on October 10, we will surpass ChatGPT in the Chinese [language] and reach the same level as it in English.”

Details about the underlying technology powering Spark Model are scarce as of the time of this article’s publishing, but Qingfeng described the AI’s capabilities as “far ahead of the existing system that can be measured in China.”

Direct comparisons between ChatGPT and similar models can be difficult to make without side-by-side benchmarking. Not only does OpenAI keep training details and other proprietary information under wraps, but ChatGPT is also banned in China — a fact that limits OpenAI’s ability to train its models on Chinese languages and culture.

The current ban on ChatGPT in China has been described as potentially stifling, especially when compared to Hong Kong — a city designated as a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China — where there’s no populace-wide ban on the use of technologies such as ChatGPT and cryptocurrency.

Related: China’s crypto stance unchanged by moves in Hong Kong, says exec

In Hong Kong and throughout the West, ChatGPT has become increasingly popular among cryptocurrency users and companies for its ability to generate code and as an underlying technology for the development of advanced trading bots and portfolio analysis. 

If the proposed upgrades to the Spark Model do manage to give iFlytek a leg up on OpenAI and ChatGPT, it would represent not only a monumental moment in tech (ChatGPT is widely considered among the most powerful of today’s generative AI systems) but it will also have done so in a relatively short amount of time.

According to Qingfeng, the company’s research arm began work on Spark Model just six months ago, on Dec. 22, 2022. By way of comparison, OpenAI began developing the precursor to its GPT products in 2015. ChatGPT wasn’t launched until Nov. 30, 2022.

South Korean lawmaker allegedly cashed out while legislating on crypto: Report

Kim Nam-kuk, a member of South Korea’s National Assembly, reportedly liquidated more than $4 million worth of crypto prior to lawmakers in the country enforcing the Financial Action Task Force’s “Travel Rule”.

According to a May 8 report from The Korea Times, authorities with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit are investigating Kim for trading roughly 6 billion won ($4.5 million) in crypto assets before South Korea introduced the Travel Rule in March 2022. The lawmaker reportedly said he did not cash out the assets but rather transferred them to another exchange, also claiming he was not required to report such activity.

As a member of South Korea’s National Assembly, Kim had some authority in handling laws related to digital assets, reportedly backing legislation proposing a 20% tax on crypto gains be deferred from 2023 to 2025. Kim has reportedly denied any potential conflicts of interest between handling crypto assets in his portfolio and ruling on them as a lawmaker.

“This is a serious moral hazard,"" said Hong Joon-pyo, mayor of the city of Daegu. “He should have left his job as a lawmaker and focused on speculative trading instead. On top of that, he stood at the forefront of delaying crypto taxation, which can be seen as an abuse of his legislative power for the protection of his private assets.""

The report came as lawmakers in the United States are considering barring members of Congress from investing in stocks and, potentially, digital assets. At the time of publication, U.S. representatives and senators were largely required to report such investments but were not bound to abstain from voting or otherwise recluse themselves should potential conflicts of interest arise in legislation or regulations.

A suspect identified only as “Hong” was detained by local authorities and arrested in the Gansu district of China after allegedly using ChatGPT to generate fake news stories.

According to a report from the South China Morning Post, Hong was detained after an investigation into an unsubstantiated article relating to a train crash was discovered on April 18 by law enforcement agents.

Hong’s arrest for “using artificial intelligence technology to concoct false and untrue information” came after cybersecurity specialists discovered at least 20 accounts had simultaneously posted the fake news article to a popular blogging site hosted by Chinese tech conglomerate Baidu.

China’s laws regarding the use of social media are considered among the strictest in the world. Police said Hong was arrested for running afoul of an ordinance against “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” a catch-all law that specifically covers spreading fake news and rumors on the internet.

If charged, Hong faces up to five years in prison under the normal statute. However, if courts view the offense as egregious, they could be sentenced to as many as 10 years under the law’s extended provisions covering crimes considered especially severe.

While the ChatGPT service is currently banned in China, its use can be obfuscated by virtual private networks (VPNs).

Related: China is developing AI without US chips: Here’s how

Similar homegrown artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as Alibaba’s “Tongyi Qianwen,” a recently announced generative AI model trained to answer questions in both English and Mandarin, have received the Chinese government’s blessing. However, as Cointelegraph reported in mid-April, it remains unclear whether Tongyi Qianwen will have the same creative abilities as ChatGPT.

The lack of robust generative AI models in China could potentially have a chilling effect on the nation’s tech scene, especially in sectors such as fintech and cryptocurrency trading, where the use of ChatGPT and products built on OpenAI’s GPT API have exploded into popularity.

Ripple has spent $200 million defending the case brought against it by the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse.

Garlinghouse dropped the figure during a fireside chat at the Dubai Fintech Summit on May 8. He stated that the U.S. is stuck compared with the regulatory progress of the United Arab Emirates virtual asset regulatory authority and the recent Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) bill in the European Union. He went on to share that by the time the case is decided, Ripple will have spent $200 million defending itself against a lawsuit which, from its very beginning, doesn’t make a lot of sense.

In a message to SEC chair Gary Gensler, Garlinghouse expressed regret about the U.S. falling behind significantly as Ripple expands to the United Arab Emirates. According to him, the tough thing about the situation is having a country that has put politics ahead of policy. Garlinghouse said one of the first pieces of advice he gives entrepreneurs when they ask him about getting something started is,” If I were you, I would not start in the United States.” He believes many U.S.-based companies and U.S. public companies would agree.

When asked about the U.S. needing a clear regulatory framework for crypto, Garlinghouse said the SEC must understand that the vast majority of people working in crypto and blockchain are good actors who want to stay within the rules of the road but need them defined.

The race to develop artificial intelligence (AI) continues as China pushes forward the development of home-grown AI without utilizing the latest technology from the United States due to current sanctions.

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, Chinese companies are studying methods to develop AI via weaker semiconductors and combinations of chips to bypass reliance on a single type of hardware. 

The report said researchers and analysts believe creating alternatives to such chips will be difficult for Chinese tech firms, but some experiments have shown “promise.”

Sanctions imposed by the U.S. against China in October 2022 have deprived Chinese companies of accessing the most advanced chips on the market. This includes Nvidia’s A100 chips and the latest version, the H100, which are the most popular options in AI development.

Currently, the Chinese market has access to Nvidia chips A800 and H800, which can only support small-scale AI models.

In April, the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba announced it would roll out a ChatGPT competitor in the “near future” called Tongyi Qianwen. Alibaba plans to integrate the chatbot within its suite of applications, including its workplace messenger DingTalk.

Crypto-friendly Hong Kong is still gung-ho about giving its citizens access to crypto trading despite other jurisdictions “taking a step back,” claims the chair of the FinTech Association of Hong Kong (FTAHK).

Speaking to Cointelegraph at the Hong Kong WOW Summit in March, FTAHK chair Neil Tan said while Singapore and the United States are seemingly stepping back from permitting crypto retail trading, “Hong Kong is stepping forward.”

On June 1, a licensing regime for crypto exchanges will come into effect, and Tan said it’s “going to also include retail.” The licensing guidelines are expected to be released sometime in May.

“If there’s access to [crypto] in a legal and regulated way, then I'm sure participants will come. It is a ‘build it and they will come’ because there are no other options. The options are dwindling, actually.”

In February, the region’s securities regulator proposed allowing retail traders access licensed crypto platforms in its licensing regime proposals for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).

It noted that denying access could push traders to unregulated overseas platforms. Currently, these platforms can only serve accredited professional investors.

In January, Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) CEO Julia Leung Fung-yee said that retail traders would be limited to “highly liquid” digital assets but did not give any further details.

Along with providing what many consider to be an attractive legal framework for crypto, Hong Kong is also focusing efforts on attracting talent and infrastructure providers — what Tan called “the back end.”

Related: China’s crypto stance unchanged by moves in Hong Kong, says exec

He added both the Chinese and Hong Kong governments recognize the opportunities in the region and are taking action to try to support inbound talent.

“There's a lot of talent across the border and right now there's a fair amount of unemployment,” Tan said on China. “There's a lot of talent that's coming from Big Tech and so forth that's able to come into Hong Kong.”

Infrastructure to support crypto also needs to be in place for Hong Kong to realize its virtual asset hub ambitions, Tan said. “When the platforms come, they come with that infrastructure. They bring the infrastructure with them as well to deliver the product,” he added.

He added the opening of the financial industry to digital assets was “just a natural progression” as cryptocurrencies “become a little bit more prominent.”

“People are actually adopting [crypto] inside of their portfolios. Whether you're talking about the retail side, high net worth or institutional investors, everyone's looking at their portfolios and trying to get that type of exposure.”

“Now we're back in business. We're opening it up.”

"What is a Wells notice, explained","A Wells notice is a letter from the SEC indicating possible enforcement action against a person or a firm.","1.
What does Wells notices mean for investors?

Investors should keep informed and consult with legal and financial experts to understand their options and possible risks because receiving a Wells notice can have major consequences for them.

A Wells notice is a formal notification from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it is considering bringing enforcement action against an individual or entity. A Wells notice normally indicates that the SEC has completed an investigation and has discovered evidence of possible violations of the securities laws. But why is it called a Wells notice? 

A Wells notice is named after John Wells, who was the SEC's general counsel from 1972 to 1976. Wells played a key role in creating the processes the SEC employs to launch enforcement actions against financial misconduct by people and businesses. The SEC adopted these procedures in 1972, giving them the names ""Wells procedures"" and ""Wells notices.""

So how serious is a Wells notice? Getting a Wells notice can worry investors because it implies that the business or person they invested in can be subject to legal action. A Wells notice, however, should be understood as an opportunity for the recipient to address the charges and make a case before the SEC decides whether to take enforcement action rather than as a final verdict of guilt or violation.

A Wells notice may impact investors in many ways — the price of the company’s stock or other securities may drop after receiving a Wells notification. Also, it can cause investors to become uncertain and concerned, which would impair their willingness to invest in the business or the overall market.

In rare circumstances, the resolution of a Wells notice may lead to fines, penalties or other sanctions being imposed against the involved company or person. These outcomes could significantly affect the company’s financial situation and future prospects, depending on the seriousness of the claimed infractions.

2.
How do Wells notices work?

A Wells notice is not a final determination of guilt or wrongdoing, meaning that the recipient has the chance to respond and make a case before any administrative action is initiated. The Wells notice procedure, though, is a clue that the SEC is considering taking action, and how it turns out might have a big impact on the recipient and any linked investors.

Consider the case where the SEC is looking into possible insider trading offenses at a publicly traded business. The SEC suspects that one of the company’s officials may have engaged in prohibited stock trading before a significant announcement was made based on non-public information.

The SEC would issue a Wells notice to the suspected employee in this situation, alerting the person to the inquiry against trading violations and giving the individual a chance to refute the charges before deciding whether to take enforcement action. So, what happens after a Wells notice is issued? Normally, the Wells notice would list the precise charges against the person and provide a deadline to reply to the SEC, as stated in the steps below.

Here’s how the Wells notice process typically works:

Investigation

To ascertain whether there is sufficient justification for taking enforcement action, the SEC looks into potential violations of securities laws.

Notification

The SEC will issue a Wells notice to the person or business in question if it decides that there is enough proof of potential misconduct. The Wells notice will normally list the particular accusations and provide the addressee a chance to reply, known as a ""Wells response.” 

For instance, Coinbase received a Wells notice in March 2023 from the SEC, who identified potential securities law violations in relation to some of its listed digital assets, the Coinbase Earn staking service, Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Wallet. The SEC issued the Wells notice after conducting a preliminary investigation.

Response

The Wells notice receiver may reply in writing or ask the SEC for a meeting in person to discuss the charges and give a defense. This response could contain arguments or supporting data to back up the defense, as well as any pertinent mitigating circumstances.

Decision

The SEC will decide whether to move further with enforcement action based on the response and any other data gathered. The SEC may file a complaint in federal court seeking fines or other remedies if it decides to pursue legal action or charges of securities fraud.

3.
How can investors respond to a Wells notice?

Some general practices to consider when responding to a Wells notice include consulting with an attorney, reviewing the allegations and developing a strategy to respond, among others.

Engage legal counsel

Getting a Wells notice can be a difficult and stressful process, so it is crucial to consult a qualified securities lawyer to get a legal defense. The best course of action can be decided after reviewing the allegations of wrongdoing with an attorney. To comprehend the SEC’s concerns and the information it has acquired, it is important to carefully read the allegations in the Wells notice and any accompanying documentation.

Create a response plan

Work with the lawyer to create a response plan that addresses the accusations and makes a strong defense. This can entail compiling further proof or spotting holes in the SEC’s argument.

Respond promptly

It is crucial to react to the Wells notice as soon as possible and by the SEC-set time. This demonstrates one’s willingness to take legal matters seriously and can lessen any potential civil penalty or fines.

Take into account settlement possibilities

Depending on the seriousness of the charges, it can be advantageous to take into account SEC settlement options, such as consenting to a cease-and-desist order or paying fines or penalties.

Maintain open communication

One should keep lines of communication open with a lawyer and the SEC employees involved in the matter at all times. By doing so, all parties involved can make sure they are well informed and identify any potential problems or obstacles.

Be prepared for potential outcomes

While receiving a Wells notice does not necessarily mean that enforcement action will be taken, it is important to be prepared for potential outcomes and understand the potential implications for one’s investments or business operations.

4.
What is the difference between Wells notices and subpoenas?

While there are differences between Wells notices and subpoenas, both are important legal tools used in regulatory and legal investigations, and both should be taken seriously by the recipients.

A Wells notice is a notification of potential enforcement action, whereas a subpoena is a legal document that requires the recipient to produce documents, testify or provide other evidence in an investigation or legal proceeding. 

In February 2023, a subpoena from the SEC was disclosed to have been received by trading platform Robinhood regarding Robinhood Crypto’s supported currencies, custody of cryptocurrencies and other platform operations. 

Here are the differences between Wells notices and subpoenas:

5.
How to avoid receiving a Wells notice?

It is crucial to abide by all applicable laws and rules governing securities transactions and disclosures in order to prevent obtaining a Wells notice.

Businesses must also have a robust internal compliance program that regularly provides staff training on legal requirements and the potential repercussions of noncompliance. In order to assure accuracy and completeness, it is also crucial to undertake thorough assessments of all financial and operational disclosures on a regular basis.

Maintaining open and transparent communication with authorities, investors and other stakeholders is also crucial. This involves being timely in responding to any queries or worries expressed by regulatory bodies and proactive in disseminating pertinent information and updates.

Working with knowledgeable legal and financial experts who are aware of the regulatory environment and can offer advice on compliance issues is crucial. Individuals and organizations can lessen their chances of obtaining a Wells notice and safeguard themselves from potential enforcement action by following these steps.","https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-wells-notice-explained"

The government of Kazakhstan received 3.07 billion tenges (approximately $7 million) in tax payments from crypto mining entities in 2022 following the implementation of an amended law regulating the fiscal burden of mining cryptocurrencies, according to local media reports.

Preliminary data from the government for 2023 shows that mining fees collected by April 27 totaled 240 million tenges, over $541,000 at the time of writing. The figures are much lower than the 652 million tenge (~$1.5 million) in fees paid in the first quarter of 2022. 

Kazakhstan ranks among the world’s top Bitcoin mining hubs. As of January 2022, the Central Asian country contributed 13.22% of the total Bitcoin hash rate, just behind the United States (37.84%) and China (21.11%), according to data from Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.

The country introduced taxes on digital mining on January 1, 2022, based on electricity consumption by mining entities. The law came into effect amid growing national frustration with crypto miners’ undertaxed usage of the national power grid, Cointelegraph reported. The amended legislation was also considered a legal path for further adoption amid tightening regulations worldwide.

A wave of foreign mining operators relocated to Kazakhstan during the 2021 bull market, impacting already tricky relations between the country and miners. Some estimates indicate that more than 87,849 rigs had been brought to the territory by November 2021 following China’s crackdown on mining activities.

Recently, the government announced plans to introduce new crypto regulations to curb tax fraud and unlawful business operations. One of the proposals calls for government approval for secured digital assets issuers, while another would require miners to sell at least 75% of crypto earned via registered exchanges. The move is expected to reduce tax evasion.

Binance is under investigation by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) national security division for allowing Russians to use the cryptocurrency exchange in violation of U.S. sanctions, according to a report that appeared in Bloomberg on May 5. There have been no accusations against the company or its executive in connection with the investigation.

The national security probe is being carried out in tandem with a criminal division investigation, the news service said, citing five unnamed sources. Binance is the object of several investigations in the United States, including a DOJ inquiry into Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations.

Binance limited services to Russia after sanctions were imposed on the country in April 2022. Still, it continued operating there, blocking only areas of Ukraine that were no longer under government control and servicing only non-sanctioned individuals, according to a company executive speaking to Cointelegraph.

Binance has also been accused of Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML violations in a suit brought by the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission in March.

The company did not reply immediately to an inquiry from Cointelegraph, but it told Bloomberg in a statement that it was compliant with U.S. and international sanctions, and its KYC protocols are in line with those of traditional banking. Every customer is subject to identity and residency checks, it said. Furthermore:

“Our policy imposes a zero-tolerance approach to double registrations, anonymous identities, and obscure sources of money.”

In addition, according to Bloomberg, Binance “has been in discussions” with the DOJ about complaints that it had violated a previous version of sanctions against Iran.

Binance is not the only crypto exchange to face sanctions violation scrutiny. Poloniex paid a $7.6 million settlement to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control for violating sanctions against Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, according to a May 1 announcement.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued its largest-ever whistleblower award totaling $279 million.

The SEC generally issues awards ranging between 10% to 30% of collected monetary sanctions larger than $1 million. To receive such an award, the whistleblower must provide information that directly assists the SEC in successfully imposing enforcement actions on a particular case.

In a May 5 statement, the SEC noted that the $279 million awarded to the unnamed whistleblower was more than double the previous record of $114 million from back in October 2020.

Additionally, the $279 million figure awarded in this latest case is more than all of the whistleblower awards issued for 2022, with the SEC dishing out $229 million across 103 awards last year.

Today we announced the largest-ever award, nearly $279 million to a whistleblower whose information and assistance led to the successful enforcement of SEC and related actions.https://t.co/GGwiZ4BQUf

— U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) May 5, 2023

“The size of today’s award — the highest in our program’s history — not only incentivizes whistleblowers to come forward with accurate information about potential securities law violations, but also reflects the tremendous success of our whistleblower program,” said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement.

These awards come from an investor protection fund established by the U.S. Congress. It is funded via collected monetary sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators and does not come from funds that are owed to harmed investors.

In these circumstances, the SEC does not refer to the specific case the whistleblower award relates to or the name of the whistleblower to protect their privacy.

As such, it is unclear if this relates to a major securities violation from the crypto sector or Wall Street.

Regarding the whistleblower, the SEC did note that they helped provide key info on a case it was already working on.

“The whistleblower’s sustained assistance, including multiple interviews and written submissions, was critical to the success of these actions,” noted Creola Kelly, the chief of the SEC’s office of the whistleblower.

“While the whistleblower’s information did not prompt the opening of the Commission’s investigation, their information expanded the scope of misconduct charged,” she added.

On May 4, Argentina's central bank banned payment providers from offering crypto transactions, alleging it intends to reduce the country's payment-system exposure to digital assets.

According to a statement from the monetary authority, payment providers may not offer or facilitate crypto services through their applications. The move brings payment fintechs and financial institutions under the same rules in the country.

""Payment service providers that offer payment accounts [...] may not carry out or facilitate operations with digital assets, including crypto assets, that are not regulated by the competent national authority and authorized by the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic,"" said the authority. Cryptocurrencies are not regulated in Argentina, which means all coins and tokens are subject to the decision.

It's unclear how the measure will affect the local crypto industry. Local media reported that payment providers refused to comment on the decision. Argentina's fintech chamber urged the government to reconsider the decision, claiming that ""it limits access to a technology that offers multiple benefits and opportunities for our society.""

Hyperinflation is driving crypto adoption in Argentina. In April, the price of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,770

 reached a record high in the Argentine peso (ARS), with the BTC exchange rate crossing over 6.59 million ARS — up more than 100% year-to-date.

In March, inflation in the country soared by 104.3% on an annual basis, following a 102.5% jump in the previous month, data from the national statistics office show.

Bitcoin’s popularity in the country also coincides with the ongoing devaluation of the Argentine peso, Cointelegraph reported. The currency has fallen almost 50% against the United States dollar in the past year.

Amid the ongoing economic crisis, even some Argentinian cities are seeking a safe haven in cryptocurrencies. Last December, the Argentine province of San Luis allowed the issuance of its own stablecoin pegged to the U.S dollar, available to all residents and 100% collateralized with liquid financial assets.

Chainalysis found that over 30% of consumers in Argentina use stablecoins for everyday purchases, most likely for small retail transactions under $1,000.

RFK Jr. elaborates position on CBDC, crypto: ‘It isn’t just criminals who want privacy’

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is challenging United States President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination in the 2024 presidential election, has taken to Twitter again to share more of his thoughts on cryptocurrency.

Kennedy criticized Biden on May 2 for calling the U.S. banking system “safe and sound” the previous day. “Today, bank stocks are crashing. The American people deserve more than glib assurances and perception management,” he tweeted.

On May 3, Kennedy condemned the Biden administration’s proposed tax on crypto mining. An environmental lawyer, Kennedy called the proposed 30% tax on energy used by crypto miners “a bad idea.” He said mining’s energy use was “a concern (though somewhat overstated),” and continued:

“The environmental argument is a selective pretext to suppress anything that threatens elite power structures. Bitcoin, for example.”

Jumping to “control” of cryptocurrency, Kennedy found more anti-establishment fodder. “It isn’t just criminals who want privacy,” he said. “Governments harass their enemies and crush dissent by controlling bank accounts and payment platforms.”

Related: Bitcoin at the barricades: Ottawa, Ukraine and beyond

Kennedy developed the theme of financial control further the following day with a look back at the Canadian truckers’ anti-vaccination protests in Ottawa in 2022. The Canadian government locked the bank accounts of people supporting the protesters. Kennedy said:

“It’s not outlandish to imagine that even here in America, your bank account could one day be frozen because of your politics, or comments you’ve made on social media.”

After all, he said, GoFundMe blocked U.S. accounts from supporting the Canadian truckers and planned to redirect the donations to other charities. Meanwhile, PayPal imposed fines on users for spreading “what they deemed to be misinformation.” Both of those decisions were successfully challenged under pressure, but Kennedy saw the hand of big government behind them anyway. “Often those private companies are acting out of fear of Congress or regulators, or directly at their bidding,” he claimed.

“That is why I oppose CBDCs [central bank digital currencies], which will vastly magnify the government’s power to suffocate dissent by cutting off access to funds with a keystroke,” Kennedy concluded.

Kennedy first voiced his opposition to CBDCs in a somewhat confused tweet relating to the FedNow instant payment system.

According to CNN on April 29, Kennedy has 19% support among Democrats. He shares his distrust of CBDCs with several Republican politicians, such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is seen as a possible challenger to candidate Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.

In addition to Kennedy, writer Marianne Williamson has declared her intention to challenge Biden for the U.S. presidency. She implied dismay at the Canadian government’s blocking of bank accounts and crypto wallets in a tweet at the time and holds that “our government has become a handmaiden to a new corporate order,” but does not mention cryptocurrency on her campaign website.

Tim Cook says Apple will weave AI into products as researchers work on solving bias

CEO Tim Cook gave a rare, if guarded, glimpse into Apple’s walled garden during the Q&A portion of a recent earnings call when asked his thoughts on generative artificial intelligence (AI) and where he “sees it going.”

Cook refrained from revealing Apple’s plans, stating upfront, “We don’t comment on product roadmaps.” However, he did intimate that the company was interested in the space:

“I do think it’s very important to be deliberate and thoughtful in how you approach these things. And there’s a number of issues that need to be sorted. … But the potential is certainly very interesting.”

The CEO later added the company views “AI as huge” and would “continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.”

Cook’s comments on taking a “deliberate and thoughtful” approach could explain the company’s absence in the generative AI space. However, there are some indications that Apple is conducting its own research into related models.

A research paper scheduled to be published at the Interaction Design and Children conference this June details a novel system for combating bias in the development of machine learning datasets.

Bias — the tendency for an AI model to make unfair or inaccurate predictions based on incorrect or incomplete data — is oft-cited as one of the most pressing concerns for the safe and ethical development of generative AI models.

The paper, which can currently be read in preprint, details a system by which multiple users would contribute to developing an AI system’s dataset with equal input.

Status quo generative AI development doesn’t add in human feedback until later stages, when models have typically already gained training bias.

The new Apple research integrates human feedback at the very early stages of model development in order to essentially democratize the data selection process. The result, according to the researchers, is a system that employs a “hands-on, collaborative approach to introducing strategies for creating balanced datasets.”

Related: AI’s black box problem: Challenges and solutions for a transparent future

It bears mention that this research study was designed as an educational paradigm to encourage novice interest in machine learning development.

It could prove difficult to scale the techniques described in the paper for use in training large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Bard. However, the research demonstrates an alternative approach to combating bias.

Ultimately, the creation of an LLM without unwanted bias could represent a landmark moment on the path to developing human-level AI systems.

Such systems stand to disrupt every aspect of the technology sector, especially the worlds of fintech, cryptocurrency trading and blockchain. Unbiased stock and crypto trading bots capable of human-level reasoning, for example, could shake up the global financial market by democratizing high-level trading knowledge.

Furthermore, demonstrating an unbiased LLM could go a long way toward satisfying government safety and ethical concerns for the generative AI industry.

This is especially noteworthy for Apple, as any generative AI product it develops or chooses to support would stand to benefit from the iPhone’s integrated AI chipset and its 1.5 billion user footprint.

In a May 5 announcement, the FCA said it had coordinated with local authorities in the cities of Exeter, Nottingham and Sheffield to raid facilities suspected of operating unregistered cryptocurrency ATMs. The enforcement action followed similar operations from March in East London and February around the city of Leeds, where the FCA said it had issued warnings or cease-and-desist requests to suspected crypto ATM operators.

“The action we’ve taken over the past few months and wider work shows that we will act to stop illegal activity,” said Therese Chambers, executive director of enforcement and market oversight of FCA. “Besides disrupting unregistered crypto businesses, the joint efforts have helped raise awareness of illegally operated crypto ATMs in the UK among the public.”

FCA authorities cited its powers under the U.K.’s Money Laundering Regulations from 2017 in conducting the inspections. According to the financial watchdog, it planned to review evidence gathered and “consider taking further action where necessary.”

According to data from CoinATMRadar, there were more than 15 crypto ATMS in the U.K. at the time of publication by operators including Big Sea Coins, BD ATMs, Cryptobitecoin and Computer House. It’s unclear whether any were registered under the FCA.

Cryptocurrency miners based in the United States could soon face a tax equal to 30% of the cost of electricity they use if President Joe Biden’s proposed budget for the fiscal year 2024 is approved by Congress, but the proposal has sparked debate about whether it would actually decrease global emissions and energy prices.

Cryptocurrency mining is a resource-intensive process that attempts to solve increasingly complex equations in order to create new blocks which can then be validated and added to the blockchain.

This process consumes a significant amount of energy, with some estimates placing the global energy consumption of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,772

 mining alone at around 0.59% of the world's energy usage, which is roughly equivalent to the energy usage of Malaysia, according to Worldometer.

Biden’s  Council of Economic Advisors (CEA), argues that the tax — dubbed the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax — “encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society,” adding:

“Estimated to raise $3.5 billion in revenue over 10 years, the primary goal of the DAME tax is to start having cryptominers pay their fair share of the costs imposed on local communities and the environment.”

By imposing a tax on electricity usage crypto miners will have a financial incentive to reduce their energy consumption, and with electricity generation making up such a large proportion of carbon emissions, this should theoretically reduce emissions in the U.S.

This idea is similar to the thinking behind carbon taxes, which are intended to disincentivize emitters by forcing them to pay the full social cost of their emissions after attempting to factor in costs associated with polluting.

Leakage

However, opponents of the tax argue that it will simply drive miners offshore to countries with lower tax rates and less stringent environmental regulations, where they will continue to emit large amounts of carbon dioxide. This situation is known as “carbon leakage,” whereby emissions are simply shifted from one location to another, rather than reduced overall.

As Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter points out, these countries may also have a much lower proportion of energy supplied by renewable sources, so emissions may even increase as crypto miners move offshore.

Carter was scathing in his critique of the policy, arguing that it would decrease tax revenue contrary to what the Biden administration suggests, increase carbon emissions, and empower “geopolitical enemies.”

In its blog post, the CEA noted that “the potential for cryptomining to relocate abroad — such as to areas with dirtier energy production — is a concern” but suggested that other countries are also moving to restrict crypto mining, and cited nine countries that already had banned the activity.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, environmental group Greenpeace USA's Bitcoin project lead Joshua Archer warned that regulations or taxes deterring crypto mining will likely be created wherever crypto miners move to, and argued that Bitcoin should eliminate its proof-of-work consensus mechanism.

The climate activism group has been calling for Bitcoin to transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism as part of its ongoing “change the code, not the climate” campaign which began early last year. 

One of the countries referred to by the CEA, China, banned crypto mining in 2021 after citing concerns about its electricity consumption and environmental impact. However, studies on the effect of the ban suggest that activity had simply moved to countries that use far less renewable energy, and actually increased global emissions.

The CEA also argued that crypto miner's electricity usage drives up costs for other consumers, and increases overall reliance on “dirtier sources of electricity.”

While this makes sense according to economic theory, as an increase in demand within a market leads to higher prices, it may overlook some important nuances of the crypto-mining industry and its effect on the electricity market in the U.S.

‘Beauty of Bitcoin’

Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings’s CEO Fred Thiel told Cointelegraph that “The beauty of Bitcoin mining is that it naturally incentivizes renewable energy generation.”

Thiel elaborated that “In many cases, green energy sources — such as solar and wind farms — are only feasible if there is consistent demand for that energy when it is produced,” adding:

“While most consumers’ energy needs fluctuate, miners act as consistent base load energy consumers. They help stabilize the grid, making new green energy projects financially feasible.”

According to Thiel, while Bitcoin mining incentivizes the production of renewable energy generation, Bitcoin miners in the U.S. are also drawn to renewable energy sources, as the excess energy they produce which is unable to be returned to the grid is some of the cheapest energy available in the U.S.

Thiel added that if this excess energy was not used by Bitcoin mining firms, it would not be able to be used by consumers and would otherwise be wasted.

Thiel noted that this mutually beneficial relationship between renewable energy producers and Bitcoin miners is contributing to an already ongoing shift towards more sustainable sources of electricity, pointing to the most recent survey by the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC).

Based on the results of the survey, the BMC estimated that 58.9% of the electricity used in Bitcoin mining throughout the last quarter of 2022 was generated by renewable energy sources, a number that is increasing over time.

AI Eye: ‘Biggest ever’ leap in AI, cool new tools, AIs are the real DAOs

Thiel was also very scathing of the DAME tax, arguing that “it is a shot at a specific industry, not at a specific practice or fuel source,” adding:

“If the Biden Administration really wanted to reduce global emissions, it would target the ways electricity is generated – not arbitrarily target select industries that use it.”

He said that the proposal “is intended to run Bitcoin miners out of business” and “will both raise energy prices for consumers and reduce the feasibility of renewable energy development in the U.S.,” concluding:

""Either the administration is utterly misguided, or this proposed tax is nothing more than a move to hamper this industry for political reasons, because it is not in the interest of the people, the energy grid, or the environment.""

The proposal comes amid calls that a lack of regulatory clarity and access to banking services in the U.S. is killing its crypto industry, and if the DAME tax is approved by Congress it may just be one more nail in the coffin.

In a May 5 announcement, the NY AG’s office planned to submit a bill called the Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency and Oversight Act, or CRPTO, in the state’s 2023 legislative session. The proposed legislation would give New York officials the enforcement power to issue subpoenas, impose civil penalties for crypto firms violating state law, and shut down companies allegedly involved in fraud or illicit activities.

Under CRPTO, exchanges would be required to reimburse users who were the victims of fraud. It would also codify the term “stablecoin” to only apply to tokens that remained backed with 1:1 United States dollar reserves or “high-quality liquid assets.”

“For too long, fraud in the cryptocurrency industry has caused investors to lose hundreds of billions, with low-income investors and people of color suffering the most,” said James. “Banks and other financial services are regulated. The cryptocurrency industry must be too.”

Today, my office is introducing nation-leading legislation to tighten regulations on the cryptocurrency industry.

We're proposing commonsense measures to protect investors and end the fraud and dysfunction that have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency.

— NY AG James (@NewYorkStateAG) May 5, 2023

The New York State Department of Financial Services, or NYDFS, currently has the authority to issue BitLicenses to crypto firms operating in the state and oversee many aspects of the digital asset space. James’ bill would also aim to strengthen that authority.

James’ office has previously taken action against crypto firms, including KuCoin, alleging the company sold securities and commodities to residents without registering in New York. The AG also filed a lawsuit against Celsius founder and former CEO Alex Mashinsky in January, claiming he made numerous “false and misleading statements” that led to investors losing billions.

New York lawmakers would need to vote on the proposed bill should it be introduced. In 2022, the legislature passed a two-year moratorium on Bitcoin

Artificial intelligence (AI) has created a furor recently with its possibility to revolutionize how people approach and solve different tasks and complex problems. From healthcare to finance, AI and its associated machine-learning models have demonstrated their potential to streamline intricate processes, enhance decision-making patterns and uncover valuable insights. 

However, despite the technology’s immense potential, a lingering “black box” problem has continued to present a significant challenge for its adoption, raising questions about the transparency and interpretability of these sophisticated systems.

In brief, the black box problem stems from the difficulty in understanding how AI systems and machine learning models process data and generate predictions or decisions. These models often rely on intricate algorithms that are not easily understandable to humans, leading to a lack of accountability and trust.

Therefore, as AI becomes increasingly integrated into various aspects of our lives, addressing this problem is crucial to ensuring this powerful technology’s responsible and ethical use.

The black box: An overview

The “black box” metaphor stems from the notion that AI systems and machine learning models operate in a manner concealed from human understanding, much like the contents of a sealed, opaque box. These systems are built upon complex mathematical models and high-dimensional data sets, which create intricate relationships and patterns that guide their decision-making processes. However, these inner workings are not readily accessible or understandable to humans.

In practical terms, the AI black box problem is the difficulty of deciphering the reasoning behind an AI system’s predictions or decisions. This issue is particularly prevalent in deep learning models like neural networks, where multiple layers of interconnected nodes process and transform data in a hierarchical manner. The intricacy of these models and the non-linear transformations they perform make it exceedingly challenging to trace the rationale behind their outputs.

Nikita Brudnov, CEO of BR Group — an AI-based marketing analytics dashboard — told Cointelegraph that the lack of transparency in how AI models arrive at certain decisions and predictions could be problematic in many contexts, such as medical diagnosis, financial decision-making and legal proceedings, significantly impacting the continued adoption of AI.

Magazine: Joe Lubin: The truth about ETH founders split and ‘Crypto Google’

“In recent years, much attention has been paid to the development of techniques for interpreting and explaining decisions made by AI models, such as generating feature importance scores, visualizing decision boundaries and identifying counterfactual hypothetical explanations,” he said, adding:

“However, these techniques are still in their infancy, and there is no guarantee that they will be effective in all cases.”

Brudnov further believes that with further decentralization, regulators may require decisions made by AI systems to be more transparent and accountable to ensure their ethical validity and overall fairness. He also suggested that consumers may hesitate to use AI-powered products and services if they do not understand how they work and their decision-making process.

James Wo, the founder of DFG — an investment firm that actively invests in AI-related technologies — believes that the black box issue won’t affect adoption for the foreseeable future. Per Wo, most users don’t necessarily care how existing AI models operate and are happy to simply derive utility from them, at least for now.

“In the mid-term, once the novelty of these platforms wears off, there will definitely be more skepticism about the black box methodology. Questions will also increase as AI use enters crypto and Web3, where there are financial stakes and consequences to consider,” he conceded.

Impact on trust and transparency

One domain where the absence of transparency can substantially impact the trust is AI-driven medical diagnostics. For example, AI models can analyze complex medical data in healthcare to generate diagnoses or treatment recommendations. However, when clinicians and patients cannot comprehend the rationale behind these suggestions, they might question the reliability and validity of these insights. This skepticism can further lead to hesitance in adopting AI solutions, potentially impeding advancements in patient care and personalized medicine.

In the financial realm, AI systems can be employed for credit scoring, fraud detection and risk assessment. However, the black box problem can create uncertainty regarding the fairness and accuracy of these credit scores or the reasoning behind fraud alerts, limiting the technology’s ability to digitize the industry.

The crypto industry also faces the repercussions of the black box problem. For example, digital assets and blockchain technology are rooted in decentralization, openness and verifiability. AI systems that lack transparency and interpretability stand to form a disconnect between user expectations and the reality of AI-driven solutions in this space.

Regulatory concerns

From a regulatory standpoint, the AI black box problem presents unique challenges. For starters, the opacity of AI processes can make it increasingly difficult for regulators to assess the compliance of these systems with existing rules and guidelines. Moreover, a lack of transparency can complicate the ability of regulators to develop new frameworks that can address the risks and challenges posed by AI applications.

Lawmakers may struggle to evaluate AI systems’ fairness, bias and data privacy practices, and their potential impact on consumer rights and market stability. Additionally, without a clear understanding of the decision-making processes of AI-driven systems, regulators may face difficulties in identifying potential vulnerabilities and ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place to mitigate risks.

One notable regulatory development regarding this technology has been the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act, which is moving closer to becoming part of the bloc’s statute book after reaching a provisional political agreement on April 27.

At its core, the AI Act aims to create a trustworthy and responsible environment for AI development within the EU. Lawmakers have adopted a classification system that categorizes different types of AI by risk: unacceptable, high, limited and minimal. This framework is designed to address various concerns related to the AI black box problem, including issues around transparency and accountability.

The inability to effectively monitor and regulate AI systems has already strained relationships between different industries and regulatory bodies.

Early last month, the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT was banned in Italy for 29 days, primarily due to privacy concerns raised by the country’s data protection agency for suspected violations of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). However, the platform was allowed to resume its services on April 29 after CEO Sam Altman announced that he and his team had taken specific steps to comply with the regulator’s demands, including the revelation of its data processing practices and implementation of its implementation of age-gating measures.

Inadequate regulation of AI systems could erode public trust in AI applications as users become increasingly concerned about inherent biases, inaccuracies and ethical implications.

Addressing the black box problem

To address the AI black box problem effectively, employing a combination of approaches that promote transparency, interpretability and accountability is essential. Two such complementary strategies are explainable AI (XAI) and open-source models.

XAI is an area of research dedicated to bridging the gap between the complexity of AI systems and the need for human interpretability. XAI focuses on developing techniques and algorithms that can provide human-understandable explanations for AI-driven decisions, offering insights into the reasoning behind these choices.

Methods often employed in XAI include surrogate models, feature importance analysis, sensitivity analysis, and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations. Implementing XAI across industries can help stakeholders better understand AI-driven processes, enhancing trust in the technology and facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements.

In tandem with XAI, promoting the adoption of open-source AI models can be an effective strategy to address the black box problem. Open-source models grant full access to the algorithms and data that drive AI systems, enabling users and developers to scrutinize and understand the underlying processes.

This increased transparency can help build trust and foster collaboration among developers, researchers and users. Furthermore, the open-source approach can create more robust, accountable and effective AI systems.

The black box problem in the crypto space

The black box problem has significant ramifications for various aspects of the crypto space, including trading strategies, market predictions, security measures, tokenization and smart contracts.

In the realm of trading strategies and market predictions, AI-driven models are gaining popularity as investors seek to capitalize on algorithmic trading. However, the black box problem hinders users’ understanding of how these models function, making it challenging to assess their effectiveness and potential risks. Consequently, this opacity can also result in unwarranted trust in AI-driven investment decisions or make investors overly reliant on automated systems.

AI stands to play a crucial role in enhancing security measures within the blockchain ecosystem by detecting fraudulent transactions and suspicious activities. Nevertheless, the black box problem complicates the verification process for these AI-driven security solutions. The lack of transparency in decision-making may erode trust in security systems, raising concerns about their ability to safeguard user assets and information.

Tokenization and smart contracts — two vital components of the blockchain ecosystem — are also witnessing increased integration of AI. However, the black box problem can obscure the logic behind AI-generated tokens or smart contract execution.

As AI revolutionizes various industries, addressing the black box problem is becoming more pressing. By fostering collaboration between researchers, developers, policymakers and industry stakeholders, solutions can be developed to promote transparency, accountability and trust in AI systems. Thus, it will be interesting to see how this novel tech paradigm continues to evolve.

Some Chinese state-affiliated banks have increasingly opened bank accounts to serve crypto clients in Hong Kong. CPIC Investment Management — a China government-backed firm regulated as a Hong Kong entity — even launched two cryptocurrency funds in April.

All these developments don’t mean that China has softened or will soften its approach to regulating Bitcoin 

BTC

 anytime soon, according to CPIC Investment Management CEO Chenggang Zhou.

“The Hong Kong government tries very hard to promote Web3 and crypto, but it doesn’t imply any changes in mainland regulatory regulations or the Chinese government’s attitude toward crypto,” Zhou said in an interview with Cointelegraph on May 5.

Zhou emphasized that despite China government’s backing, CPIC Investment Management operates as a Hong Kong entity regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission.

“Hong Kong regulations allow us to invest in different markets or asset classes or products like cryptocurrencies, so we’re not breaching any regulations or laws,” the CEO said. He added:

“We got involved in crypto because Hong Kong regulations allow us to do that. But it’s in no way any indication of the China government’s attitude or policy, or change of policy.”

China has maintained its anti-crypto stance for a long time, even before banning crypto entirely in September 2021, Zhou noted. He said that he doesn’t expect the local government to change its crypto policies in the foreseeable future.

The CEO isn’t alone in thinking that China remains and will remain anti-crypto while trying to beef up Chinese bank deposits with crypto accounts.

“Given that the Chinese government is coming down hard on the financial sector, it is hard to imagine that China is loosening its control over the ability for Chinese nationals to use crypto,” Lesperance & Associates founder David Lesperance told Cointelegraph.

Related: Hong Kong court rules cryptocurrencies as property

According to Lesperance, China wants to increase its foreign currency deposits, whether that is fiat to purchase crypto or crypto itself. “They are bifurcating the markets to shut out domestic Chinese customers but attracting foreign customers,” he noted.

The lawyer also noted that the crypto market in mainland China is “still effectively shut down.” That raises enforcement concerns about Chinese clients getting a chance to use Hong Kong exchanges to get money out of China. “Certainly, the authorities will try to stop this leakage,” Lesperance noted.

CPIC’s Zhou also mentioned that crypto exchanges in Hong Kong have strict Know Your Customer policies, which aim to restrict mainland Chinese investors on their platforms.

“I don’t expect any licensed crypto exchanges in Hong Kong to accept onshore mainland citizens to trade in the exchanges,” Zhou stated.

Among the eight technologies are artificial intelligence, communication and network technologies, biotechnology and semiconductors, with the inclusion of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and digital identity infrastructure grabbing the crypto community’s attention.

DLT permits concurrent access, record validation and record updating throughout a networked database. Blockchain technology is based on DLT, making it possible for users to see any changes and the people who made them, lowering the need for auditing data, ensuring data reliability, and restricting access to only those who actually need it.

The national strategy aims to increase U.S. leadership in the development of international standards for these emerging technologies. The U.S. government is actively involved in building synergies with the private sector to promote and build international standards for such emerging technologies.

The most prominent example of such collaboration is the development of the telecom and communications standard. For example, the initial proposal for 3G was made in the 1990s by Qualcomm Technologies, with the subsequent recommendation for LTE — the dominant standard for wireless broadband communication for mobile devices and data terminals — made in the 2000s by NTT Docomo, a major Japanese mobile phone provider.

The national strategy suggests the likes of DLT and digital infrastructure would increasingly impact and be widely used in the economic sector. Some key areas where these technologies will be actively tested include automated and connected infrastructure, such as smart communities and the Internet of Things. DLT can especially find great use in building cybersecurity and privacy-based features and services.

Zimbabwe’s central bank has set a price for its gold-backed digital tokens. The country is planning to sell its gold-backed digital currency to investors starting May 8. The tokens will be sold at a minimum price of $10 for individuals and $5,000 for corporations and other entities.

According to a statement released by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe on May 4, the gold-backed digital currency tokens will be sold in U.S. dollars and local currency. However, the local currency price will have a 20% margin above the willing-buyer willing-seller interbank mid-rate. Interested investors can participate in the offer from May 8, which will close two days later.

The willing-buyer willing-seller interbank mid-rate is the exchange rate at which banks are willing to buy and sell currencies to each other. It is considered the “midpoint” between the buying and selling rates determined by prevailing market conditions such as supply and demand. This rate is used as a benchmark for many financial transactions, and is often used as a reference rate for exchange rates quoted by banks and financial institutions.

The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe announced its plans to introduce a gold-backed digital currency to serve as legal tender in the country on April 28.

The introduction of digital tokens is the latest move by the southern African nation to support its own local currency, which has weakened 37% against the U.S. dollar on the official market this year, according to Bloomberg.

The Monetary Policy Committee approved the plan in March, eight months after Zimbabwe introduced gold coins as a store of value to help support the local unit.

According to a Bloomberg report, Zimbabwe’s currency — the Zimbabwean dollar — is quoted at 1,001 against the U.S. dollar, but is commonly exchanged at 1,750 on the streets of Harare, the capital city of the country.

Zimbabwe has been battling currency instability and high inflation rates for over ten years. After a period of hyperinflation, the country adopted the U.S. dollar in 2009. In an attempt to revive the struggling economy, the Zimbabwean dollar was reintroduced in 2019. However, in 2022, the government reverted back to using the U.S. dollar to control rising prices.

Nigeria introduced its own digital currency — the eNaira — in 2021, becoming the first African nation to do so.

The vice president of the United States and President Joe Biden’s top advisers have held a meeting with several AI industry CEOs to discuss “concerns about the risks associated with AI.”

On May 4, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris was joined by nine top Biden administration advisers in science, national security, policy and economics, meeting with the CEOs of OpenAI, Microsoft, Google and AI startup Anthropic.

Notably, tech giant Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was absent from the meeting.

Before the meeting, the White House released a flurry of AI-related announcements regarding the funding of AI research facilities, government AI policy and AI systems evaluation.

The meeting focused on the transparency of AI systems, the importance of evaluating and validating the safety of AI and ensuring AI is secured from malicious actors, according to the announcement.

Reportedly, the government and the tech CEOs agreed “more work is needed to develop and ensure appropriate safeguards and protections” for AI.

The CEOs committed to engaging with the White House to ensure Americans can “benefit from AI innovation.” No specific details were shared on what safeguards were needed or what the engagement with the government exactly entails.

Zuckerberg was absent from the meeting despite Meta working on AI for years. A White House official told CNN, “It was focused on companies currently leading in the space.”

The Biden administration also highlighted its work to address national security concerns posed by AI, specifically mentioning cybersecurity and biosecurity, without going into specifics.

It said these efforts would ensure AI firms “have access to best practices” to protect AI networks from state cybersecurity experts from the “national security community.”

White House banks big on AI

On the same day, the Biden Administration announced it would put aside $140 million to launch seven new national AI research institutes, bringing the total to 25 across the country.

“These Institutes bolster America’s AI [research and development] infrastructure,” the White House said. It added the institutes would “drive breakthroughs” in areas such as “climate, agriculture, energy, public health, education, and cybersecurity.”

In a separate announcement, the government said AI development firms including Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Hugging Face and Stability AI will also participate in publicly evaluating AI systems on a platform from AI training firm Scale AI at the hacker convention DEFCON in August.

Finally, the White House said it would release a draft policy on how the U.S. government will use AI, which will be will be made available for public comment this summer.

Policies around the development, use and procurement of AI by federal departments and agencies will be drafted. It said the policies would be a model for state and local governments in their own procurement and use of AI.

Coinbase remains ‘100% committed’ to US market — Armstrong

Coinbase‘s CEO has a lot of faith that Congress will make a “clear rule book” for crypto firms to follow. But the Securities and Exchange Commission? Not so much.

United States-founded cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has no plans to move its operations out of the U.S., CEO Brian Armstrong told investors in an Q1 earnings call.

On May 5, Armstrong assured shareholders that the firm is “100% committed” to the U.S. market over the long term despite regulatory uncertainty in the U.S.

“So let me be clear, we’re 100% committed to the U.S. I founded this company in the United States because I saw that rule of law prevails here. That’s really important, and I’m actually really optimistic on the U.S. getting this right.”

The optimism alluded to by Armstrong comes from his confidence in Congress soon passing a clear set of rules for crypto firms to follow:

“When I go visit DC, there is strong bipartisan support for Congress to come in and create new legislation that would create a clear rule book in the U.S. and I think it's really important for America to get this right.”

However, Armstrong’s comments weren’t entirely optimistic.

The CEO is concerned about the unpredictable enforcement action of the Securities Exchange Commission, which comes in light of the firm being served with a Wells notice by the securities regulator in late March:

“Despite our ongoing engagement with the commission, they have not been as clear about what their specific concerns are with Coinbase as we might like, and so I have to refrain from speculating too much.”

“It's especially difficult to predict the timeline of any potential SEC litigation that we might face,” Armstrong added.

The troubles led Coinbase to file an action in a U.S. federal court seeking to compel the SEC to answer a petition that has been pending since July.

The back and forth comes as Coinbase launched Coinbase International Exchange (CIE) on May 2, which prompted many pundits to believe that Coinbase was looking for an escape route from the U.S.

The exchange is open to customers in 30 countries worldwide, including Singapore, Hong Kong, El Salvador, Philippines, Thailand and Bermuda — where CIE is now licensed from.

Armstrong said the European Union is “in front” in terms of regulatory progress with its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation set to enter into effect in mid-2024 or early 2025:

“They've adopted comprehensive crypto legislation called MiCA, creates a single clear rule book for the entire region. It's pretty powerful.”

“I just got back from a trip from the U.K. and D.C. Both of those have draft bills in the works that are working on things like around stablecoins and market structure — Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, Brazil; all are essentially following in this direction,” Armstrong added.

The CEO’s remarks come as Coinbase managed to increase its first-quarter revenue by 22% while slashing its net income loss by over $475 million, to $79 million.

Terraform Labs is seeking to have a class-action lawsuit against the firm dismissed, arguing the United States securities laws referenced are not applicable to its foreign-developed protocols.

On May 3, Terraform Labs requested a California federal judge dismiss an investor suit brought by Nick Patterson that claimed the company sold unregistered securities and misled investors.

The firm’s attorneys, Dentons, argued that federal securities laws do not apply since the protocols were developed and used outside of the United States.

Excerpt from dismissal motion, Case No. 3:22-cv-03600. Source: Law360

The Terra/Luna ecosystem collapsed in May 2022, wiping out billions from the crypto markets. The crash has sparked a raft of lawsuits against the firm, associated entities such as the Luna Foundation Guard, and company founder Do Kwon.

In June 2022, this particular class action was filed, claiming that the Terra tokens — TerraUSD (UST) and LUNA — were securities, among other allegations.

According to Law360, Terraform’s dismissal motion argued that federal securities laws and the mail and wire fraud accusations in the suit only apply domestically.

“The federal securities laws do not apply because the SAC [Second Amended Complaint] does not allege that any of the protocols at issue were developed domestically.”

The same argument also applies to the suit’s RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) allegations, which claimed the firm’s goal was to reap profits at retail investors’ expense, according to Terraform.

Nick Patterson, who filed the suit on behalf of investors, did not adequately plead that mail and wire fraud allegations occurred domestically, it argued.

The motion also states that the plaintiff failed to identify the location of digital wallets containing his Terra tokens, which negates any “domestic injury” claims, according to Terraform.

Terraform and Do Kwon were sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in February, with the regulator claiming they orchestrated a multibillion-dollar securities fraud.

In April, a South Korean court ruled that LUNA was not a security under the country’s Capital Markets Act.

On April 25, Terraform Labs co-founder Hyun-seong Shin and nine individuals associated with the firm were indicted in South Korea.

They were reportedly indicted on charges of fraud, breach of trust and embezzlement and referred to trial following almost a year of investigation.

Kenya’s lawmakers are considering the introduction of a 3% tax on cryptocurrency and nonfungible token transfers and a 15% tax on monetized online content, according to a newly introduced bill.

Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

Introduced to the Kenyan parliament on May 4, The Finance Bill 2023 would enact a digital asset tax on “income derived from the transfer or exchange of digital assets,” and also includes specific language for NFTs.

The bill will undergo five rounds of readings, committees and reports by the National Assembly; if passed, it will then go to the president for final assent into law.

Crypto exchanges or those who initiate the transfer of crypto or NFTs would be required to collect the tax, having to deduct 3% of the transfers’ value to be paid to the government. Exchanges not registered in Kenya would have to register under the tax regime.

The bill also seeks to bring about a tax on “digital content monetization,” levying a 15% tax on content creators paid to promote and advertise products and services online including but not limited to sponsorships, affiliate marketing, merchandise sales and paid subscriptions.

The digital assets section of the bill has seen a mixed response online.

Some were pleased to see that crypto and NFTs were seemingly now officially recognized in the country. Previously, the Central Bank of Kenya has warned against using crypto but no outright prohibitions were put in place.

Rufas Kamau, a Kenyan research and markets analyst, tweeted on May 4 that the 3% tax wa“a joke” and sarcastically asked if it applies to “supermarket and credit card loyalty points.”

Kenyan crypto advocacy group, Cryptocurrency Kenya, tweeted that such a digital tax “must apply to [...] everything digital,” claiming a crypto-only tax is “targeted harassment.”

It also pointed out the tax was higher when compared to the fees charged by exchanges, comparing the government's proposed 3% tax to Binance’s 0.10% trading fee.

Kenya first made an effort to regulate crypto in November, introducing amendments to its capital market laws requiring those who own or deal in crypto to report information on their activities to the authorities.

Kenya scrapes into being in the top 20 countries when it comes to crypto adoption. A September report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis placed the country 19th in terms of crypto adoption.

Funds stuck on the platform of bankrupt crypto broker Voyager Digital may begin returning to creditors in “the next few weeks,"" according to a committee of Voyager creditors.

Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

A May 4 tweet from the Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (UCC) said the now-defunct crypto firm is in the final stages of bankruptcy liquidation procedures. The UCC is “hopeful” that “initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.”

The UCC’s update comes 10 days after Binance.US backed out of its initial agreement to purchase $1.02 billion worth of Voyager’s assets, with the crypto exchange blaming “the hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States” as the reason for abandoning the deal.

Fortunately, Voyager’s restructuring plan includes a “toggle option” that allows the firm to pursue self-liquidation following the decision by Binance.US to pull out of the deal. This allows the bankrupt broker to distribute cash and crypto to customers directly via the Voyager platform.

The UCC was dismayed by Binance.US’ move, stating that it would be investigating potential claims against the cryptocurrency exchange for its last-minute change of heart.

It’s worth noting that Voyager must now file the liquidation procedures with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. According to the committee, parties have 10 days to file any objections with the liquidation procedures.

The UCC explained if no objections are filed in the next 10 days then “Voyager will “go ‘effective"" with the plan.” If an objection is filed, however, the court will hold a hearing to consider the objection before the liquidation plan can go through.

An overwhelming majority, 97%, of the 61,300 Voyager customers who voted on the court’s restructuring plan voted in favor, although at that time voters believed that Binance.US would acquire the stranded assets.

Greg Gianforte, the governor of Montana, has signed into law a bill largely preventing local governments in the state from passing laws prohibiting cryptocurrency mining.

Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

According to records with the Montana legislature, Gianforte signed S.B. 178 into law on May 2 after the bill had passed both the state House and Senate. The legislation effectively enshrines crypto miners’ rights in the state by revising existing laws, prohibiting discriminatory electrical rates for mining firms and not allowing taxation for crypto used as a method of payment.

The latest version of the bill suggested that the legislation was introduced partly as a preventive measure in response to certain proposals in other states — i.e. “digital asset mining has often faced difficulty with regulations at the state and local level."" For example, in April, lawmakers in the Texas state Senate introduced a bill aimed at limiting incentives for crypto miners through participation in a program intended to compensate them for load reductions on the state’s power grid.

Crypto advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund has supported pro-mining legislation in certain states. Lawmakers in the Arkansas state House and Senate passed a bill similar to Montana’s S.B. 178 — ""to clarify the regulation of the digital asset mining business"" — with Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signing it into law on April 13.

“At the state level, we can have a lot of progress, we can move things forward, and there isn’t a whole lot the federal government can do in the meantime,” said Porter.

Related: The economics of cryptocurrency mining: Costs, revenues and market trends

Similar pro-mining legislation had been moving forward in the Mississippi state legislature, but the bill “died” in March. Porter said a Missouri bill was “a further little behind in the process” but still progressing in the legislature.

At the federal level, the Biden administration recently renewed a push for a 30% tax on cryptocurrency miners as part of an FY2024 budget proposal. The tax would potentially target miners’ electricity usage.

The administration of United States President Joe Biden released a national standards strategy for critical and emerging technologies on May 4. The strategy stated that the U.S. would prioritize standards development in eight areas. Among the prioritized areas are “digital identity infrastructure and distributed ledger technologies, which increasingly affect a range of key economic sectors.”

“Distributed ledger” is a synonym for blockchain. Digital identity is “the unique representation of a subject engaged in an online transaction,” according to a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) document now under review. Digital identity is “unique in the context of a digital service, but does not necessarily need to uniquely identify the subject in all contexts,” the document added.

NIST is the federal agency that coordinates government standards activity.

One obvious use of digital identity in economic sectors is Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML), where blockchain solutions are being actively developed as regulators and enforcement agencies demand greater AML compliance in the U.S. and around the world in the crypto industry.

Related: Europe’s digital ID wallet — Easy for users or a data privacy nightmare?

Innovations such as zero-knowledge KYC verification, based on the blockchain’s consensus mechanism, have been proposed to carry AML verification, credit scoring and similar information. Passporting techniques using soulbound nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have been deployed to make off-chain identity accessible.

Privacy issues are deeply intertwined with digital identity and are areas where the government and crypto industry have yet to reach accord.

The goal of the strategy is to protect U.S. consumers and the country’s role in developing international standards, the White House said. The strategy will bolster investment in “pre-standardization research” in the key areas identified, encourage private-sector and academic participation in that research, invest in training, and ensure integrity and inclusivity.

The Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Research leads the government’s work on digital identity, digital assets and distributed ledger technology in federal and international agencies.

The judge presiding over crypto exchange FTX’s bankruptcy case has given the green light to a motion allowing the sale of LedgerX.

Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

In a May 4 hearing in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Judge John Dorsey approved a motion the FTX debtors filed in April to sell LedgerX to M7 Holdings, an affiliate of Miami International Holdings. FTX said at the time of the purchase agreement that the total proceeds of the transaction would total roughly $50 million.

According to lawyers speaking at the hearing, there were no objections to the sale of LedgerX. A representative who spoke on behalf of OKC USA Holding — one of the other bidders for LedgerX — largely did not object to the proceedings but said the firm “reserve[s] all of their rights to seek appropriate relief” relating to a declaration filed by Bruce Mendelsohn, a partner for the FTX debtors’ investment banker. The lawyer claimed Mendelsohn made “not true” statements in regard to OKC’s regulatory obligations to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. government.

“Well, that was easy,” said Dorsey, in reference to the brief hearing. The judge said he had read all the papers and declarations related to the motion and was “satisfied” with the proceedings.

The court ruling represented a step forward in FTX’s bankruptcy case and the potential for investors to be made whole following the firm filing for Chapter 11 in November 2022. The bankruptcy court approved the sale of certain FTX entities in January as part of the proceedings.

FTX.US purchased LedgerX in August 2021. During a congressional hearing exploring the collapse of the crypto exchange, CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said that LedgerX was “healthy,” “solvent,” and “operational” compared to other FTX entities.

The bankruptcy court has yet to make a ruling on a motion from several media outlets requesting it release the identities of certain FTX customers. Opponents of the motion have suggested that not allowing certain personal information to be redacted could make individuals the targets of scammers and bad actors.

Microsoft recently announced a slew of new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered features for its Bing chatbot and Edge web browser. Chief among the changes, Bing users now have full access to the GPT-4 model — the same underlying engine that powers ChatGPT’s “Plus” subscription service.

Previously, Microsoft held access to the GPT-4 version of the Bing chatbot to a “limited preview.” It’s now announcing open availability through the Bing app, web access and the Edge browser.

Aside from giving Bing, Edge and Windows users free, unfettered access to the GPT-4 model, Microsoft also announced upcoming support for multimodal outputs, chat history and plug-ins.

Multimodal support will allow the Bing chatbot to generate responses, which include a combination of text, images and videos. It will also have the ability to generate charts and graphs, something that could give it a leg up over ChatGPT.

Users will also have access to their full chat history and, for those using the Edge browser, the ability to move chats to the sidebar to continue surfing in the same tab. Microsoft says this feature will be implemented “starting shortly.”

In the future, according to the blog post, Bing may even be able to reference previous sessions when interacting with users:

“Over time, we’re exploring making your chats more personalized by bringing context from a previous chat into new conversations.”

Perhaps the most ambitious addition announced is “Edge Actions,” also referred to as “Bing Actions,"" Microsoft’s term for upcoming integrations featuring third-party plug-ins for Bing chat.

The only plug-ins specifically mentioned in the announcement are OpenTable, which would allow users to reserve seats at restaurants directly within the chat interface, and Wolfram/Alpha, a modality that would allow users to create complex visualizations for math and science queries. Microsoft says more integrations will be revealed as they’re implemented.

The new features won’t require any purchases or subscriptions, though users will need a free Microsoft account to take advantage of the Bing chatbot’s full suite of functions.

By contrast, OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus service costs $20 per month for access to the same GPT-4 model (the freely available ChatGPT service relies on GPT-3.5). Furthermore, ChatGPT Plus doesn’t currently offer image generation, web search or third-party plug-in support.

It’s unclear how Microsoft and OpenAI intend to balance their respective offerings. Experts weighing in on social media have expressed confusion over what appears to be competition for users, as the companies essentially partnered up after Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI.

ChatGPT and Bing Chat keep colliding, and it's unclear how this will end.

- Why pay for ChatGPT Plus when Bing Chat also uses GPT-4?
- If you are paying for Plus, why use Bing Chat when ChatGPT will have browsing soon?
- And now, both have plugins!

— Pete (@nonmayorpete) May 4, 2023

As it currently stands, those paying for ChatGPT Plus do receive certain benefits not available to the general public or Bing chatbot users. These include early access to new features, priority access to the system even during periods of high traffic and faster response times from the model.

The cryptocurrency world has seen an explosion of interest in chatbot technologies throughout 2023. Developers have built advanced autonomous trading bots on the GPT-4 platform, and many individual crypto users have begun employing chatbots for a variety of reasons.

It’s unknown at this time if OpenAI intends to adjust its subscription offering in the face of Bing’s ubiquity — Microsoft says the search engine now boasts 100 million users, while the addition of Bing AI to the Windows taskbar gives it a potential global reach of more than half a billion users per month.

The House of Representatives for North Carolina has unanimously passed legislation aimed at prohibiting payments to the U.S. state using a central bank digital currency, or CBDC.

In a May 3 vote, 118 members of the state’s legislative body agreed to pass House Bill 690, with only two representatives absent and none voting against the bill. The latest version of the legislation aimed to prohibit individuals from using CBDCs for any payments to the state, as well as bar the Federal Reserve from using North Carolina as a potential testing ground for its own CBDC pilot.

North Carolina lawmakers introduced the bill to the House in April, where it stayed in committee before readings and a full vote. The legislation proposed amending statutes to require “no State agency nor the General Court of Justice” accept payments using CBDCs or participate in Fed testing of a digital dollar.

The legislative push against CBDCs seems to be becoming more politically relevant ahead of the 2024 elections in the United States. In March, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis — expected by many to throw his hat into the ring for the U.S. presidential race — called for a CBDC ban in the country, claiming the technology was all about “surveilling Americans and controlling behavior of Americans.”

At the federal level, Representative Tom Emmer and Senator Ted Cruz have both introduced separate bills aimed at restricting the Fed’s authority over CBDCs or proposing an outright ban. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., another U.S. presidential hopeful, has claimed that CBDCs could “grease the slippery slope to financial slavery and political tyranny.”

The North Carolina bill will move to the Senate, where it must pass before being signed into law or vetoed by Governor Roy Cooper. The Board of Commissioners for North Carolina’s Buncombe County also approved a one-year moratorium on crypto mining on May 2.

The use and popularity of cryptocurrencies have significantly increased in recent years, but their decentralized nature makes them difficult to regulate, and the lack of a clear framework has led to concerns about money laundering, terrorist financing and consumer protection. Over 90 countries have introduced cryptocurrency regulations since 2014, with 28 adopting crypto-related laws in 2022.

The Cointelegraph Research Blockchain Regulation Database provides an overview of the legal landscape surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrency worldwide as well as the regulations that apply to various activities. Through its user-friendly interface, the database provides information on matters such as the legal status of crypto in multiple jurisdictions, the latest news and updates, and compliance assistance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism requirements. It’s updated weekly and reviewed monthly for perfect data accuracy, meaning it can be a helpful tool for those involved in the crypto space.

The regulatory landscape for crypto varies widely across the globe. Countries like Japan and Switzerland have established clear rules around cryptocurrencies. Japan has been recognized as “well developed” and an “early mover” in crypto regulation, while Switzerland updated its Financial Market Supervisory Authority AML ordinance in November 2022 to prevent large payments from being split to avoid identity checks.

Asia

South Korea has implemented a law to regulate virtual assets under which all crypto service providers must register with financial regulators and adjust their AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) systems. The country’s Ministry of Justice also plans to introduce a “Virtual Currency Tracking System” in 2023 to combat money laundering and develop an independent tracking system in the second half of the year.

China adopted a more forceful stance by banning initial coin offerings, a commonly used method to raise funds for cryptocurrency ventures. Moreover, the Chinese government has taken measures to control the crypto exchange and mining industries, expressing concerns over financial instability and illegal activities. Similarly, Vietnam prohibited the use of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,849

 and other similar cryptocurrencies as payment methods.

South and North America

On the other hand, the United States has no overarching regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken a particular interest in the space and has brought several high-profile enforcement actions against companies that have violated securities laws in relation to their crypto offerings.

In South America, cryptocurrency regulation is still in its early stages, with each country taking a different approach toward the emerging technology. On May 5, 2022, the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA) issued a statement explicitly stating that financial institutions are prohibited from facilitating crypto transactions on behalf of clients or providing digital asset trading services to customers. The Colombian government, in turn, has taken a more proactive approach to cryptocurrency regulation, with cryptocurrency exchanges required to register with the government and AML and KYC requirements in place to monitor transactions.

Europe

The European Union is actively regulating cryptocurrencies and in March 2023 introduced an updated Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive that requires cryptocurrency exchanges to perform KYC checks on their customers and report suspicious transactions.

The EU is also currently considering a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies that would align them with existing financial regulations. In Germany, cryptocurrencies are recognized as financial instruments and are subject to the same regulations as other financial instruments. In contrast, France has implemented a tax regime that is favorable to cryptocurrency transactions, as only converting crypto into fiat currency, realizing gains exceeding 305 euros ($337) from the disposal of assets, and acquiring crypto through mining are taxable events.

Exploring the prospects

Regulating crypto is tough due to its decentralized nature, but a global regulatory body for crypto could help. Clear, predictable frameworks have the potential to improve confidence and development and help protect consumers from fraud.

Crypto regulation is a complex, ever-changing field, with each country seeking to develop an individual approach. And so far in 2023, the efforts of lawmakers only continue to intensify.

The United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has turned its attention to artificial intelligence (AI) after announcing an examination of the impact of the technology on consumers and the economy.

On May 4, the regulator said it would be looking at the development and deployment of foundation models — applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT — against key principles. Those include safety, transparency, fairness and accountability, among others. 

Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, commented that since AI tools “burst” into the public sphere, regulators have had their eye on it.

“It’s a technology developing at speed and has the potential to transform the way businesses compete as well as drive substantial economic growth.“

She continued by deeming it “crucial” that businesses and consumers in the U.K. have access to the potential benefits of AI technologies while being shielded from fake information. AI-generated fakes have already started populating the web, resulting in lawsuits. 

The initial review will examine the competitive market for AI foundation models and their usage. Regulators plan to monitor how they can expand and present opportunities, along with risks to competition and consumers.

The CMA says its goal is to help the technology develop in ways that “ensure open, competitive markets and effective consumer protection.“

Additionally, the review is intended to produce “guiding principles” for the protection of consumers and support healthy competition as the technologies develop. A report on the findings is scheduled to be published in September 2023.

This announcement follows the publication of a white paper on AI from the U.K. government in March 2023.

On April 25, the U.K. prime minister and technology secretary revealed funding of 100 million British pounds ($124.8 million) to support a task force to accelerate the country’s AI readiness.

According to a May 4 announcement from Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit responded to the complaint against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the need for clear rules for trading digital assets. This marks a development in the legal battle for regulatory clarity.

According to Grewal, the court’s response to their complaint against the SEC was a text-only order. The court has instructed the SEC to respond to Coinbase’s writ of mandamus within ten days. A writ of mandamus is a court order addressed to an inferior government official, ordering them to fulfill their official duties properly.

Grewal stated that the court had granted Coinbase the right to file a reply to the SEC’s response within seven days of the filing. He also expressed appreciation for the court’s thorough examination of the case.

Coinbase — the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange — filed a lawsuit in April requesting that the court compel the SEC to publicly disclose its stance on a petition submitted several months prior. In the petition, the exchange posed 50 specific questions about the regulatory treatment of certain digital assets. The questions were wide-ranging, covering topics such as how tokens are classified as securities and seeking clarification on various other matters.

Despite the lack of public response to the petition, the SEC has increased enforcement and issued warnings to crypto exchanges. The commission has even issued a Wells notice to Coinbase in the past. A Wells notice letter typically warns a company that the SEC may follow with an enforcement action.

Due to the ongoing regulatory issues faced by the company, U.S. investment bank Citigroup downgraded the shares of the crypto exchange from “buy” to “neutral” and has also lowered its price target. The bank has cited “too many unknowns” as the reason for this downgrade. According to Citi analyst Peter Christiansen, the downgrade will be Until the regulatory “rules of the road” are better established in the United States.

The government of Nigeria — one of the world’s most curious nations about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin

In the announcement, The Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy (FMCDE) cited a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicting the widespread adoption of blockchain technology across various industries could potentially contribute $1.76 trillion to the global gross domestic product by 2030, representing 1.4% of the world’s GDP.

The FMCDE developed the national blockchain policy through stakeholder consultations in both the public and private sectors. The policy was developed on behalf of the federal government of Nigeria, in line with the seventh pillar of the national digital economy policy and strategy, which focuses on digital society and emerging technologies.

A draft of the blockchain adoption strategy, released in October 2020, stated that blockchain and decentralized ledger technology would “facilitate the development of the Nigerian digital economy.”

The policy aims to establish a blockchain-based economy that facilitates secure transactions, data sharing and value exchange among individuals, businesses and the government. The implementation of the policy is expected to have a favorable impact on the public and private sectors in Nigeria.

The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) will be responsible for coordinating the policy initiatives under the supervision of the FMCDE. Additionally, a multisectoral steering committee has been established to oversee policy implementation.

The Federal Executive Council has instructed relevant regulatory bodies, such as NITDA, the Central Bank of Nigeria, the National Universities Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nigerian Communications Commission to create regulatory frameworks for the implementation of blockchain technology in different sectors of the economy.

The strategy for blockchain adoption includes initiatives aimed at establishing a consortium for blockchain in Nigeria, strengthening the regulatory and legal framework, promoting digital identity, creating blockchain business incentive programs, fostering digital literacy and awareness of blockchain technology, and establishing a national blockchain sandbox for testing and piloting.

Despite this new policy, transactions using cryptocurrency remain illegal in the country.

Four media outlets in the United States have continued efforts to get the identities of non-U.S. FTX customers revealed, filing new objections to a previous motion to seal their identities.

Bloomberg, Dow Jones, The New York Times and the Financial Times first filed a motion objecting to FTX and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors being authorized to redact and withhold customer information on Jan 11.

While the court previously had heard similar arguments by the four firms, the May 3 filing made a new objection to the Committee’s motion to seal the identities of non-U.S. customers.

The four media firm’s most recent filing against FTX and the Committee. Source: Kroll.

The media outlet's most recent argument is that there is no legal basis to redact the names pursuant to non-U.S. data privacy laws.

The media giants argued that under section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code — the provision which grants the bankruptcy court judicial power — there is no part that permits foreign law to override the right of access to information under U.S. constitutional and statutory law:

“At bottom, Movants desire to avoid ‘enforcement of the public disclosure requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law’ [...] furnishes no basis for sealing.”

“The law of the United States — constitutional and statutory — guarantees the public a strong presumptive right to inspect bankruptcy filings. That right cannot be abrogated by a party’s assertion of legal obligations under foreign law,” the media firms added.

The first argument raised — which was claimed in an earlier filing — was that the names of FTX’s creditors do not constitute “confidential commercial information.”

The second — also raised in an earlier filing — is that such disclosure wouldn’t subject the creditors to “undue risk.”

FTX and the committee have until May 4 at 4:00 pm Eastern Time to submit an objection.

The hearing date for the filing will take place on May 17 at 1:00pm.

The United States securities regulator is holding off from ratifying the definition of the term “digital assets” in rules that govern reporting disclosures for hedge and private equity funds, despite proposing to do so some nine months ago.

Advertisement
Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

On May 3 the Securities and Exchange Commission published amendments to Form PF — a form that SEC-registered funds complete to disclose basic information about their fund so the regulator can assess potential “systemic risks.”

The SEC originally included a digital assets definition in an August 2022 proposal for the changes. If it went into effect, it would have been the first time the SEC defined “digital assets.”

Fast forward to today, and the regulator says it’s not going ahead with adding the definition, at least for now.

“We proposed adding ‘digital assets’ as a new term to the Form PF Glossary of Terms. The Commission and staff are continuing to consider this term and are not adopting ‘digital assets’ as part of this rule at this time.”

The definition the SEC put forward for digital assets was an asset “that is issued and/or transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology” and included other commonly used terms such as “virtual currencies,” “coins” and “tokens.”

The SEC said in its August proposal that currently, information regarding a fund’s digital assets is reported in an “other” category, which results in “less robust Form PF data for analysis.”

It proposed the definition in order to obtain separate, and, by extension, more accurate reporting on such assets.

“We believe it is important to collect information on funds’ exposures to digital assets in order to understand better their overall market exposures.”

However, the latest updates to the SEC’s Form PF rules now require — among other things — that SEC-registered funds report the occurrence of key events that could indicate systemic risk or harm to investors in a likely response to the U.S. banking crisis.

Related: SEC’s war on crypto: How far will it go?

Firms must also disclose details of their fees and expenses as the SEC tries to cast a light on the multi-trillion dollar sector.

The SEC hasn’t always shied away from crypto-related definitions, announcing in mid-April that it would revisit its definition of an “exchange” to possibly include decentralized finance (DeFi).

SEC Chair Gary Gensler has also long been vocal in claiming that cryptocurrencies are securities under his commission’s remit and that the U.S. crypto sector is acting afoul of securities laws.

The former OpenSea manager who was accused of insider trading of NFTs has been convicted on May 3 of wire fraud and money laundering in a New York federal court, according to Reuters.

According to prosecutors, Nathaniel Chastain, a former product manager at OpenSea, was in charge of choosing which NFTs would be featured on the website’s nonfungible token marketplace.

After making these decisions, he frequently purchased these NFTs and then resold them after they had been featured, prosecutors said. He was charged with wire fraud and money laundering on June 1 in connection with these alleged transactions.

The trial began on April 24 and has been watched closely by lawyers specializing in crypto-related issues. Some legal experts have argued that the outcome of the case may affect whether NFTs are considered securities.

According to the May 3 report, defense attorney Daniel Filor argued in the trial’s closing statements that Chastain wasn’t guilty because he had never been told the information was supposed to be confidential, stating “Nobody told Nate that he couldn't use or share that information.""

By contrast, prosecuting attorney Allison Nichols argued that Chastain knew he was breaking the law. She claimed that he used anonymous OpenSea accounts to make the trades, implying that he was afraid of being caught.

“He hid what he was doing,” Nichols reportedly told the jury in her rebuttal. “He knew that he had violated OpenSea’s confidentiality agreement.”

It marks the first time a person has been slapped for using privileged knowledge to trade nonfungible tokens.

A former employee of Coinbase, Ishan Wahi, and his brother Nikhil were also charged with insider trading of cryptocurrencies in a separate case in July. In that case, Nikhil Wahi pleaded guilty on September 12.

Lawyers representing cryptocurrency and stock trading app Robinhood faced off against those for the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts over the legality of a state regulation that could affect how the company markets itself to potential investors.

Under Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts William Galvin, the office's securities division filed a complaint against Robinhood in December 2020 alleging the platform illegally targeted inexperienced investors, claiming the practice was in violation of the state’s fiduciary duty standards. Galvin reportedly said at the time that Robinhood was marketing itself as “some sort of game that you might be able to win” and aimed to revoke the platform’s broker-dealer license in Massachusetts.

Robinhood has argued that the Massachusetts securities regulator exceeded its authority in attempting to enforce the fiduciary duty rules. In March 2022, a judge largely dismissed the regulator's position, leaving the matter on hold pending appeal, with oral arguments scheduled for May.

According to a Reuters report, Robinhood’s legal team returned to court on May 3, claiming Massachusetts law did not give Galvin “the power to make conduct that is ethical under existing federal and state law unethical simply by announcing it to be so.” Lawyers for the state office reportedly reiterated the regulator’s claims that the fiduciary duty aimed to protect investors from techniques Robinhood had allegedly used.

The case followed a tragic story from June 2020 in which a 20-year-old Robinhood investor committed suicide after seeing a $730,000 negative balance in his account — reportedly a ​​temporary condition that could have resolved itself in time. The platform has also sometimes been the target of crypto users on social media following outages during peak trading periods, resulting in more than one class-action lawsuit.

In April, Robinhood settled with securities regulators in Alabama, Colorado, California, Delaware, New Jersey, South Dakota and Texas, agreeing to pay more than $10 million in penalties “for operational and technical failures that harmed main street investors.” The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a private organization in the United States that regulates member brokerages and exchanges, also fined the firm roughly $70 million in 2021 for causing “widespread and significant harm” to thousands of users.

As of December 2022, Robinhood reported it had roughly 500,000 users registered in Massachusetts, with accounts totaling more than $1.6 billion. Cointelegraph reached out to the Massachusetts regulator's office, but a spokesperson did not comment on the secretary's position.

The French Senate’s Committee on Economic Affairs recently approved an amendment to pending legislation allowing registered cryptocurrency companies to hire social media influencers for advertising and promotional purposes.

Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

According to a translation of the amendment provided by Bing, the new wording would allow companies that are registered with France’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF) to hire influencers for their products:

“The current wording is more restrictive than the existing provisions in the Consumer Code, since it excludes the possibility for digital asset service providers (PSAN) registered with the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) to use commercial influence. Consequently, this amendment introduces this possibility for PSANs registered or approved with the AMF.”

In its original iteration, the bill in question called for what essentially amounted to an outright ban on influencer advertising for the crypto industry in France. Its wording limited the companies who could engage in influencer advertising to only those licensed by the AMF, a bar no cryptocurrency company currently meets.

As Paris-based law firm Beaubourg Avocats points out in an educational blog post, ""France has established a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency that primarily relies on two regimes: the token sale or ICO (Initial Coin Offering) visa and the Digital Assets Service Providers ('DASPs') registration and license.”

All cryptocurrency companies operating in France are legally required to register with the AMF. So far, none have received the necessary licensing that would allow them to hire influencers to promote their products in the nation legally.

Related: France mulls fast-tracking registered crypto firms to new EU rules

The change of language in the amendment would eliminate the licensing requirement and thus allow companies that are simply registered with the AMF to pay influencers for promotion on social media.

Crypto Twitter appears to be hailing the news as a positive step for the French influencer and cryptocurrency markets.

It does however bear mention that the change hasn’t been officially ratified yet. Along with a series of other revisions, the proposed amendment must pass through the full Senate in a plenary meeting before it faces approval by the National Assembly.

Securities token platform INX has launched a wallet with compliance features for institutions, according to a May 3 announcement. The new wallet was created in partnership with wallet infrastructure provider BitGo and uses multi-party computation (MPC) technology.

INX securities tokens exist on the Ethereum network and follow the ERC-1404 token standard. The standard was created in 2018 to allow for compliance-friendly Ethereum tokens. These tokens can only be transferred between users that have passed identity verification with a participating institution.

The new wallet allows institutions to comply with cybersecurity and custody standards in the financial industry when holding INX securities tokens. No single person is given access to the private key that controls a given account. Instead, the key is split into three or more “shards” that have to be combined to sign transactions, which is part of the MPC technology.

According to the announcement, the wallet also contains features to make employee access privileges easier to manage. Companies can task different employees with different roles, such as “viewers, spenders, approvers and administrators.” They can also segregate clients’ assets by splitting up funds into multiple wallets and giving “approver” privileges to each individual client. This allows institutions to give their clients more control over their individual accounts, the announcement said.

Lisa Jowett, head of platform sales at BitGo, said she thinks these new features will help make institutional investors more comfortable using Web3 technology:

“Our wallets can connect to and interact seamlessly with [the INX platform] without compromising on security or reliability. This will unlock new possibilities for investors and serve as a gateway for institutional adoption of Web3.”

INX reached a major milestone on April 3 when it launched its first equity token from a public company, Greenbriar Capital. INX advisor Douglas Borthwick has argued that eventually “all assets will migrate to the blockchain.”

The company is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker-dealer within the United States. Some industry experts have argued that the U.S. doesn’t have clear enough crypto regulations to allow most crypto exchanges to gain this designation.

US lawmakers introduce bipartisan bill proposing ban on members investing in ‘financial instruments’

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle in the United States House of Representatives have backed a bill prohibiting members of Congress and their spouses and dependents from trading or owning certain financial instruments — which could extend to investments in digital assets.

Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

In a May 2 announcement, Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and Raja Krishnamoorthi, as well as Republican Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick and Matt Gaetz, introduced the Bipartisan Restoring Faith in Government Act. An April 28 draft of the bill proposed amending U.S. laws applying to congressional members to prohibit ownership of securities, securities futures, and commodities, as well as limiting owning or trading certain assets.

Under the bill, congressional members who are invested in such assets would largely be required to sell them or place them in a blind trust within 90 days of passage. Failure to comply with the law could result in civil charges from the U.S. Attorney General potentially leading to fines of up to $50,000.

“The ability to individually trade stock erodes the public’s trust in government,” said AOC. “When Members have access to classified information, we should not be trading in the stock market on it. It’s really that simple.”

Though the four members of Congress pointed to stock trading as one of the reasons for the bill, the text suggested ownership of certain cryptocurrencies could also be included in the ban. Members of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have said Bitcoin 

BTC

 qualifies as a commodity, while some are still unclear regarding the asset status of Ether 

ETH

.

In 2021, AOC said she personally avoided investments that could potentially represent a conflict of interest — a policy she applied to stocks and crypto. Under the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act, U.S. lawmakers are largely required to report investments but still allowed to oversee or propose legislation on matters potentially related to companies for which they own stock.

Many experts have suggested that the penalties for lawmakers who fail to disclose investments under the current rules were an insufficient deterrent for potential conflicts of interest. Representative Lois Frankel reportedly sold her stock in the troubled First Republic Bank and purchased some for JPMorgan prior to the sale, suggesting insider knowledge used for profit.

Policymakers have previously suggested ways to expand the scope of the STOCK Act to outright prohibit certain investments, without success. Many in the U.S. public have suggested the practice of allowing members to own stock or accept financial contributions on behalf of companies was ethically dubious. For example, some executives at defunct crypto exchange FTX, including former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, donated to campaigns for both Republican and Democratic lawmakers.

It’s unclear whether the bipartisan bill will have enough votes to move through both the House and Senate before arriving on President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.

Cryptocurrencies were designed to be anonymous or pseudonymous, so there is an inherent tension when protocols come up against jurisdictional authorities. 

In the United States, the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector has jousted with regulators over the need to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules, and even over adherence to economic sanctions regimes. 

Most recently, a top U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) official suggested in a speech that it behooves the industry to verify the digital identity of its users. The CFTC has historically been friendly to the crypto sector — at least when compared with other U.S. agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission — so its views might be worth considering.

However, is it possible “for all crypto companies to distance themselves from [digital currency] mixers and anonymity-enhanced technology,” as CFTC commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero urged in an April 25 speech?

What about decentralized exchanges? Romero said central parties maintain them, and they could do KYC and AML if they wanted to. But would forcing compliance risk driving decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation abroad?

“Sure, it’s possible for companies to distance themselves from anything they want — software does what we tell it to do,” Preston Byrne, a partner at the law firm Brown Rudnick, told Cointelegraph, adding:

“The real question is whether the United States, as a policy matter, wants to cut off its companies from DeFi when DeFi growth overseas is exploding.”

Whether crypto protocols have to comply with AML/KYC rules and other aspects of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) depends on whether they are “money transmitters” or “money services businesses” under the applicable state and federal laws, according to John Wagster, who heads the technology industry team at law firm Frost Brown Todd. But whether they can comply is another matter. He told Cointelegraph:

“Centralized protocols clearly have the ability to implement AML/KYC compliance, albeit at the risk of losing crypto idealists who will only use products that allow permissionless, anonymous access.”

What about DeFi projects? “Decentralized protocols can implement BSA compliance, but the individual steps must be approved by the protocol’s DAO — or another governance mechanism — and some aspect of the implementation will likely need to be performed by community members or service organizations authorized by the DAO,” Wagster added.

But the BSA isn’t the only potential challenge for crypto firms looking to set up business in the United States; it might not even be the most serious.

All companies must comply with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) “to ensure their platforms are not being used by individuals from prohibited jurisdictions,” like North Korea and Iran, or by specially designated nationals, said Wagster. However, “some aspects of OFAC compliance can be implemented autonomously through the use of third parties like Chainalysis, which provides access to its OFAC API free of charge.”

Magazine: How to control the AIs and incentivize the humans with crypto

In August 2022, OFAC sanctioned digital currency mixer Tornado Cash, which the agency accused of laundering more than $7 billion of digital currency since its creation in 2019. This included over $455 million stolen by a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group. Mixers like Tornado facilitate anonymous transactions “by obfuscating their origin, destination, and counterparties, with no attempt to determine their origin,” according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. OFAC has since prohibited U.S. firms and individuals from doing business with Tornado Cash.

Some believe that decentralized exchanges can also shut out mixers if they set their mind to it. “When the whole Tornado Cash debacle happened, decentralized exchanges like Aave and dYdX actively blocked addresses that interacted with mixers,” Justin Hartzman, CEO and co-founder of Toronto-based cryptocurrency exchange CoinSmart, told Cointelegraph. As Hartzman further explained:

“While mixers do tend to protect user identity, it is fairly easy to tell which addresses have interacted with these protocols, thanks to blockchain’s transparency.”

Still, even if crypto firms can resist anonymity-enhanced technology, would that be beneficial? Perhaps preserving privacy coins and anonymous crypto is important globally as a counterweight to growing government surveillance.

“The answer to this question is in the eye of the beholder,” said Byrne, adding that the desirability of privacy-enhancing technology is a political question. “I think the point of crypto is to make this technology so commonplace that it ceases to be a political question because its existence must be assumed.”

Privacy coins and regulations ‘don’t gel’

“If you want widespread adoption, regulations are going to be crucial,” said Hartzman, adding that “privacy coins and regulations don’t gel.” While doubting privacy coins are going away, their usability will probably remain highly “niched” and restricted, he explained. “Blockchain was never anonymous, and it won’t be moving forward in my view.”

Frost Brown Todd’s Wagster, for his part, agreed that there was a basic incompatibility at hand:

“Anonymizing technology and BSA compliance do not mix. If a protocol is required to be BSA compliant, that protocol cannot permit users to mask their identities.”

Protocols seeking high adoption by attracting institutional investors are “unlikely to defend the use of mixers because their institutional users are not going to get involved with a platform that is in danger of a government enforcement action,” continued Wagster. Meanwhile, DeFi lenders who permit anonymizers will just have to do business outside U.S. jurisdiction.

Are ‘mixers’ worth saving?

Is the verification of digital identity, as requested by the CFTC commissioner, really such a burden for crypto users, and is it worth the industry’s while to fight for “mixers” like Tornado Cash and Blender?

Anonymity is not a life and death matter for the vast majority of crypto users, in Hartzman’s view. “Most people are simply using crypto to make money and trade these radically different and exciting assets.” They aren’t using mixers either. “I would say that most don’t even know how to use these protocols.” Brown Rudnick’s Byrne added:

“Tornado Cash and Blender aren’t worth saving in my opinion, although I am sympathetic to the arguments [...] that the Treasury Department probably doesn’t, or at least it shouldn’t have the power to sanction particular technologies.”

Wagster noted that BSA requirements like AML and KYC are enforced by the U.S. Treasury through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, “not by the SEC or CFTC.”

Many centralized crypto protocols will likely embrace AML/KYC/OFAC requirements because they are widely used in the traditional financial world and “because institutional money managers may have a fiduciary duty to use compliant providers.”

On the other hand, some crypto-native DeFi protocols may want to avoid BSA compliance, Wagster said, as “compliance runs against the ethos of crypto that favors privacy and monetary freedom over the government’s desire to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.”

Mixers aren’t always used for nefarious purposes, either. People living under oppressive political regimes may use these tools to protect their wealth and freedom, CoinSmart’s Hartzman noted, but “the fact is that hackers are abusing these protocols to safely steal money from hardworking people.”

Compliance regimes can vary in importance too. KYC/AML compliance may be one thing, but sanctions evasion is arguably another. As the sad saga of Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith illustrated, it’s a surefire way to incur the wrath of U.S. authorities.

“Treasury has worked to expose components of the virtual currency ecosystem, like Tornado Cash and Blender.io, that cybercriminals use to obfuscate the proceeds from illicit cyber activity and other crimes,” declared the Treasury in August 2022.

While acknowledging that most digital currency activity is “licit,” the department said that cryptocurrencies “can be used for illicit activity, including sanctions evasion through mixers, peer-to-peer exchangers, darknet markets, and exchanges. This includes the facilitation of heists, ransomware schemes, fraud, and other cybercrimes.”

Give regulators what they want?

As a strategic matter, would it better suit the crypto sector to give U.S. regulators what they want, i.e., ID verification? Consumers have been doing it for years for other activities like opening a bank account, and if developers don’t like it, they can just set up shop outside U.S. jurisdiction.

“Ultimately, some DeFi providers will likely end up adopting AML/KYC procedures, whether they are required to or not, both to avoid unwanted government scrutiny and to attract institutional money,” predicted Wagster. “Others will hold true to their ideological preferences because that’s why they got into crypto in the first place.”

Hartzman, based in Toronto, cites the Canadian regulatory approach, which, in his view, has worked well. “All exchanges must register with the Ontario Securities Commission/Canadian Securities Administrators and undergo stringent regulatory processes and audits.”

Recent: SEC crackdown on crypto staking in the US could boost decentralization

What’s needed in the U.S., though, is a regulatory framework designed specifically for cryptocurrencies, Hartzman continued:

“It seems U.S. regulators have still not decided if cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities or something else. [SEC chair] Gary Gensler’s train-wreck of a hearing pretty much proved that these regulators are behind the eight-ball when it comes to the crypto industry.”

Byrne also suggested that U.S. regulators may arrive too late to the party to do anything forcible on the anonymity question. “While I can understand that U.S. regulators want to exercise regulatory control, I think that commercial reality outside our borders is going to start demonstrating the practical limits on their power sooner rather than later.”

Artificial intelligence (AI) brings yet another industry into a hot debate over its usage as Hollywood and the greater media industry faces petitions from the Writers Guild of America (WGA).

The WGA recently sent out a list of demands that included the regulation of AI usage on the minimum basic agreement (MBA) covered projects. It stated that AI should not be used to write or rewrite literary material nor be used as source material.

Additionally, it demanded that MBA-covered material can’t be used in training AI. In its initial statement back in March, the guild wrote:

“The WGA’s proposal to regulate use of material produced using artificial intelligence or similar technologies ensures the Companies can’t use AI to undermine writers’ working standards including compensation, residuals, separated rights and credits.”

However, Hollywood studios have officially rejected the demands and countered with an offer of “annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology.”

This issue pertaining to AI usage was one of many, including compensation and working conditions, that pushed the WGA to go on an authorized strike in Los Angeles on May 2 for the first time in 15 years. 

Ellen Stutzman, the chief negotiator for the WGA, called the proposal “reasonable” and said that AI should be kept “out of the business of writing television and movies.” She also commented that some members of the guild had penned the name “plagiarism machine” for AI.

AI tools are already being implemented in Hollywood for touching up visuals and de-aging actors’ appearances, among other things. 

Hollywood production studios’ stance of openness to emerging technologies, such as AI, differs from the stance of major companies in other creative industries like the music industry.

The initial response of Universal Music Group after AI-generated music started popping up on streaming services was a manhunt to get them removed, along with lawsuits. Though some artists themselves with established names in the industry are encouraging the usage of the technology.

Amid regulatory struggles in the United States, crypto exchange Coinbase has decided to expand its business abroad with a global platform. Following the news, crypto community members expressed their opinions, with some criticizing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and others expressing confidence in crypto’s future.

On May 2, the exchange announced the launch of Coinbase International Exchange (CIE), a crypto derivatives platform catering to institutional investors. Trading on the exchange will be offered to institutional clients in eligible jurisdictions outside the United States.

Coinbase has been preparing this move since March, as many U.S. regulators took aim at crypto firms for their perceived roles in the collapses of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. 

As the company’s international exchange was launched, various community members expressed their support for Coinbase and crypto’s growth worldwide. Tyler Winklevoss, the CEO of Gemini, which also recently launched a global derivatives platform, tweeted that “crypto is global” and said it’s important that everyone is leaning into this.

Meanwhile, a community member said Coinbase’s new move is a good step for crypto. “Crypto is the future and it is taking off, with or without certain countries who choose to over-regulate against crypto,” they tweeted. On Reddit, a community member believes that Coinbase made a great decision. According to the Redditor, it’s better for Coinbase to be safe than sorry.

While some celebrated the new development, others turned their pitchforks toward U.S. regulators. Community member Jesse Dow expressed dissatisfaction toward SEC chair Gary Gensler, accusing him of being “someone with an agenda.“

Moreover, CryptoLaw founder John Deaton claimed that the SEC has “failed miserably to protect investors.“ The lawyer said the commission had not maintained fair, orderly and efficient markets.

The U.K. government announced its new fraud strategy, pledging 400 new jobs to update its approach to intelligence-led policing. The government will work alongside the telecoms regulator, the Office of Communications, commonly known as Ofcom, to use new technology to counter phone number “spoofing,” which would prevent fraudsters from impersonating legitimate U.K. phone numbers.

According to Bloomberg, wire fraud is now the most prevalent crime in the U.K., with 1 in 15 people falling victim to it. To ensure more victims of fraud get their money back, the government aims to introduce laws that require financial institutions to reimburse victims of authorized fraud.

A report published on Jan. 29 by media outlets, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Observer, shows that organized crime syndicates are utilizing the U.K. as their operational base owing to the region’s “lenient regulations.“ Registering a company in the U.K. costs as little as 12 British pounds ($14.85). It requires no form of identification, making it easy for fraudulent companies to register there and gain sham credibility.

The U.K. government has been trying to clamp down on cryptocurrency companies operating in the region. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) mandated that all companies engaged in crypto asset activity register with it per the existing Financial Services and Markets Act rules for the digital assets market.

However, the FCA has adopted a strict approach to granting approvals, leading to several crypto-related businesses operating as unregistered entities. The regulator appears to be striving to balance providing a secure environment for investors and promoting innovation in the industry.

U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reportedly said in a statement that scammers “ruin lives in seconds, deceiving people in the most despicable ways in order to line their pockets.“ He pledged to fight these fraudsters wherever they attempt to hide. The government also promised to put an end to methods commonly used by scammers to reach thousands of people at once, such as “SIM farms.“ The use of mass-texting services will also be reviewed to prevent these technologies from falling into the hands of criminals.

A cryptocurrency YouTuber has been served a lawsuit through a tweet after a United States court allowed the action, as lawyers claimed they couldn’t serve him through other means.

The May 2 order from a Florida district court judge granted The Moskowitz Law Firm permission to serve legal notice to crypto YouTuber Tom Nash via a tweet.

Nash, believed to reside in Georgia, is the last of ten defendants named in a class-action lawsuit against influencers alleged to have promoted the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX without disclosing their compensation.

On May 2, the firm tweeted its notice to Nash and mentioned his Twitter handle in the post, thereby giving him legal notice of the lawsuit.

The filing set out instructions on how Nash would be served using Twitter.

A legal notice URL was required to be shared by the law firm through its official Twitter account, tagging Nash’s Twitter account.

Moskowitz was also required to send the URL in an email to his publicly known email address.

The filing states Nash’s frequent internet use suggests that it is a reliable way of contacting him. It noted:

“Nash has an established Internet-based business, utilizes electronic means, including Twitter, as reliable forms of contact; and has publicly acknowledged [a] personal email address.”

According to the filing, when lawyers previously emailed Nash on an address he had publicly posted, it didn’t bounce back, which suggested Nash received the suit and his “e-mail address is valid and operational.”

A federal ruling allows the district court to “order an alternate method for service to be executed on foreign defendants,” provided it isn’t against international agreements and is likely to effectively notify the defendant.

It further explained that Georgia and the U.S. are parties to The Hague Convention, which provides a standardized method for serving legal documents between countries that are signatories of the treaty.

The other nine defendants comprise seven YouTubers, including Graham Stephan, Brian Jung and Ben Armstrong, known as “BitBoy Crypto.” The talent management company that handled the promotion of FTX, Creators Agency and its founder Erika Kullberg, are also named.

Armstrong had missed a court appearance on April 20 to address his alleged “harassment towards plaintiffs’ counsel.”

Instead of attending the court hearing, Armstrong posted pictures of himself on a beach in the Bahamas on Twitter and openly mocked the order.

Cointelegraph contacted Nash for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

Nine digital currency exchanges allegedly aiding and abetting cybercriminals had their domains seized by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation and Ukrainian law enforcement.

According to a May 1 press release, the FBI’s Detroit Field Office and the National Police of Ukraine “conducted coordinated, court-authorized activity” that resulted in the shutdown and seizure of the domains of nine virtual currency exchange services.

The seized domains included the websites 24xbtc.com, 100btc.pro, pridechange.com, trust-exchange.org and bitcoin24.exchange. Each reportedly offered entirely anonymous digital currency exchange services to their users, skirting many of the rules and regulations required of licensed crypto exchanges.

Anyone attempting to access these websites will see a seizure notice from the authorities.

The FBI noted the exchanges, which offered services in both English and Russian, featured “lax” Anti-Money Laundering measures and collected minimal Know Your Customer information or “none at all.”

The FBI claimed these kinds of rogue, unlicenced exchanges “serve as important hubs in the cybercrime ecosystem.”

According to the agency, many of these virtual currency exchanges were “advertised on online forums dedicated to discussing criminal activity.”

“Much of the criminal activity occurring at the affected exchanges involved cyber actors responsible for ransomware, but also other scammers, and cybercriminals.”

The FBI has been involved in a number of cryptocurrency-related issues over the past few months.

 and two nonfungible tokens worth more than $100,000 from a reported phishing scammer. The seizure was the result of a lengthy investigation by independent blockchain sleuth ZachXBT, who first exposed the activity on Twitter in Septtember 2022.

The lawyers and consulting firms assisting cryptocurrency exchange FTX through its bankruptcy proceedings are set to cash in a total of $103 million over the first quarter.

March saw five firms — Sullivan & Cromwell, Alvarez & Marshal, AlixPartners, Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Landis Rath & Cobb — bill FTX a combined $36.4 million, according to several court filings between April 28 and May 2.

The invoices from March were slightly higher than January and February’s figures of $34.2 million and $32.5 million, respectively.

New York-based law firm Sullivan & Cromwell again walked away with the biggest paycheck, billing $14.1 million in fees and expenses for March, adding to a total of $44.4 million over the first quarter.

Partners at the firm took home $2,165 per hour while paralegals and legal analysts were paid $425 and $595 per hour for their contributions.

Consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal came in next, invoicing over $13.8 million in March for the tens of thousands of hours it collectively committed to avoidance actions, financial analysis and accounting procedures.

It was the third successive billing of over $10 million for the firm, which has served as FTX’s restructuring advisor since Sam Bankman-Fried’s former empire filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11.

Fellow law firms Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Landis Rath & Cobb respectively billed FTX $3.19 million and $644,000 in March for respective totals of $7.3 million and $1.9 million over the first quarter.

As Landis Rath & Cobb serve as FTX’s special counsel, the firm has spent most of its hours in the courtroom attending court hearings and undergoing litigation procedures.

Over 180 lawyers from Sullivan & Cromwell, Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Landis Rath & Cobb have been assigned to work on the FTX case.

Forensics consulting firm AlixPartners invoiced its largest bill at $4.51 million in March, totaling $10.2 million over the quarter, for the firm’s work in analyzing decentralized finance products and tokens in FTX’s possession.

Despite a severely troubled six months, FTX hasn’t put the nail in the coffin yet.

With $7.3 billion in assets recovered FTX’s legal team is eyeing a potential reboot of the trading platform as early as April 2024.

The Biden administration has renewed its push for a 30% Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) tax on cryptocurrency miners, part of efforts to minimize the industry’s alleged impact on climate change.

The proposed crypto-mining tax was first announced on March 9 as part of President Joe Biden’s FY2024 budget and seeks to impose a phased-in 30% excise tax on electricity used by crypto-miners.

“An excise tax on electricity usage by digital asset miners could reduce mining activity along with its associated environmental impacts and other harms,” the Department of Treasury wrote at the time. Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,849

 fell under $20,000 just a day later.

However, a May 2 statement from the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has brought the proposal back to light again, in attempts to justify the need for the new tax.

“Currently, cryptomining firms do not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others, in the form of local environmental pollution, higher energy prices, and the impacts of increased greenhouse gas emissions on the climate,” the CEA wrote.

“The DAME tax encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society,” it wrote, adding:

“While crypto assets are virtual, the energy consumption tied to their computationally intensive production is very real and imposes very real costs.”

The blog also referenced reports suggesting crypto mining has “negative spillovers” on the environment, quality of life and electricity grids and that pollution from electricity generation falls on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color while pushing up the cost of electricity for consumers.

It even suggests that crypto mining using existing clean power (such as hydropower) can still have a negative impact on the environment, by pushing other electricity users to “dirtier” sources of electricity.

The Twitter thread posted by the Council of Economic Advisers has attracted widespread criticism from the community, with some calling it “misinformation” and “propaganda,” while one Twitter user argued such a tax would “simply push Bitcoin mining to Russia & other countries.”

Defunct crypto lender Celsius Network is looking to combine its United Kingdom and United States entities as new court filings allege that any supposed distinction between the two companies was a “sham.”

Advertisement
Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

The central point of dispute is focused on a decision made by the crypto lender in June 2021, when Celsius Network Limited (CNL) was issued with a warning to cease operations in the U.K. from the country’s Financial Conduct Authority.

To avoid fallout, CNL set up a Limited Liability Company — Celsius Network LLC — in the state of Delaware and looked to transfer its assets to the new company.

According to a May 1 court filing from the now-bankrupt crypto firm, the migration of the two entities “resulted in intercompany chaos.” The filing adds that formal documentation of the intercompany relationship was “not completed for several months” and when it was “it remained ambiguous” what transactions the agreements affected.

The filing claims that for everyday investors, the result of this transfer was too confusing to make sense of; however, the more “sophisticated” Series B investors were well aware of the implications of such dubious recordkeeping.

As a result, the two entities should be treated as one and the same in subsequent bankruptcy proceedings, so that smaller creditors are not ignored in favor of Series B investors when it comes to the recovery and return of lost funds.

According to a corresponding court filing from the Celsius Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (UCC), the migration was a “sham” and the transactions that facilitated the transfer of billions of dollars worth of assets between the two were likely fraudulent.

Simon Dixon, who reportedly lost more than $8.8 million worth of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,849

 as a result of the Celsius collapse, summarised the UCC filing in a series of tweets on May 2, saying that “Celsius acted as if the migration never occurred” and was given “poor documentation” and “no clear distinctions” to distinguish between the two entities.

In a March 9 memorandum opinion, Chief U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn found that customers only had claims against Celsius’ Delaware-based LLC, meaning that Series B investors stand to be more likely to receive recompensation.

Related: Celsius creditors demand transparency on ‘suspicious’ FTX transactions

The auction of the remaining Celsius assets is scheduled to go ahead on Wednesday, May 3, with a number of major firms including the exchanges Coinbase and Gemini vying for possession of the defunct firms’ assets.

NovaWulf Digital Management currently stands as the “stalking horse bidder,” a term used to describe the first mover that sets the bar for the ensuing bids. NovaWulf’s proposal includes a direct cash contribution in the range of $45 million to $55 million. If NovaWulf’s proposal is accepted, customers can expect to recover up to 70% of their funds.

The auction marks a significant step forward for Celsius’ customers in recovering their funds, after the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 14, 2022.

Retail CBDCs bring unknown ‘consequences’ to financial system — IMF director

A myriad of unforeseeable “consequences” could be brought about by retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), the managing director of the International Monetary Fund has claimed.

Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

The IMF's Kristalina Georgieva erred on the side of caution regarding retail CBDCs in a May 1 interview at the Milken Institute’s 2023 Global Conference.

Georgieva explained the IMF considers retail CBDCs to have far more room for error than wholesale CBDCs.

“We think that wholesale CBDCs can be put in place with fairly little space for undesirable surprises, whereas retail CBDCs completely transform the financial system in a way that we don’t quite know what consequences it could bring.”

Retail CBDCs are state-backed virtual currencies issued by central banks for use by consumers and businesses.

Wholesale CBDCs are similarly central bank-issued but are designed to allow financial institutions to carry reserve deposits with a central bank.

The IMF is collaborating with about 50 countries to ensure best practices are adopted, Georgieva said, which she expects to have a huge influence on the banks and economies in the future.

“We are engaging with countries, we work with some 50 countries now on this very topic,” the IMF executive said.

“We will see a very significant transformation that comes from CBDCs.”

Georgieva noted that “even” the United States is engaging in CBDC development now, which led her to conclude that “the future” of CBDCs is now here:

“Even in the U.S. where that was for quite some time a topic of not great interest, now there is engagement, and for the right reason. The future has arrived.”

The IMF announced on April 12 that it will publish a CBDC handbook to help central banks with CBDC design and implementation. The financial agency of the United Nations said the decision came following “unprecedented” levels of interest from nations around the world.

US congressmen chide presidential advisers over crypto stances in economic report

United States Congressmen Warren Davidson and Mike Flood have written a letter to the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) demanding an explanation for a chapter the agency prepared for the ""Economic Report of the President"" that expressed “a hostile view towards the digital asset ecosystem.” 

Advertisement
Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

The report, presented to Congress in March, contained a chapter titled “The Reality of Crypto Assets” that claimed such assets “have brought none of the promised benefits.” The agency’s opinion marked a reversal of the position taken in the president’s “Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets,” the lawmakers claimed. They wrote:

“We are working to do our part in Congress to put forth a regulatory regime for digital assets that will allow this innovative ecosystem to thrive in the U.S. while enacting critical protections.”

“By taking such a hostile view towards the digital asset ecosystem, the Administration is only pushing digital asset innovation offshore,” they wrote. This posture, they added, will start “drawing capital and economic growth away from the U.S. to the benefit of other countries.”

The letter raised questions, many of which immediately sprang to the minds of crypto supporters who objected to the claims made in the report. The writers asked how firms can comply with the law “when the laws that allegedly apply are conflicting, for example when a product is considered both a security and a commodity.”

Related: ‘Keep Your Coins’ bill introduced to restrict government control of crypto

They further asked why the agency dismissed the role of Congress by saying much of the activity in the crypto space is covered by existing regulations. They wrote, “Is it the CEA's view that legislation from Congress will not mitigate potential risks and provide consumers with more protections than exist today?”

Finally, the lawmakers demanded to know why the agency, which is part of the Executive Office of the President, claimed that the soon-to-launch FedNow instant payment system and central bank digital currency would be simpler and more effective than digital assets in upgrading the financial system.

The letter did not explain what purpose the requested information would serve. The authors set a May 26 deadline for the answers.

Davidson is a longtime crypto advocate who in April introduced legislation to remove Gary Gensler from the chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Flood introduced a bill as a Nebraska state legislator in 2021 that would allow financial institutions in the state to operate digital asset depository businesses. That bill was signed into law. On the federal level, Flood supported Rep. Tom Emmer’s “CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act” when it was unveiled in February.
